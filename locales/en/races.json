        "desc": "HumansHumans are a relatively new race to Saloa but are quite fertile and have spread across the realms in abundant numbers. They vary greatly in cultures, often aping those of neighboring races, only to turn them around into something different. They are largely traders and because of their expertise with numbers and money they often have been enslaved by other races. Interestingly humans are often the most aggressive races so they are often going to war with other perhaps more peaceful if more powerful races. As a result they have a reputation as being barbaric and warlike even though many other humans are simple farmers and traders.AppearanceAmong the races humans range the most widely in height and weight. They tend to average just under 6 feet tall but can be as small as 4 feet or as tall as 7 feet tall at the tallest. Their hair tends to be red, brown, or blonde with blond and red being the rarest colors. They have eye colors varying from black to brown to blue to gray. They have skin tones from very dark brown ebony to pale white ivory with many tones between. Humans tend to wear drab work clothing but brighter colors for special occasions and holy days.HistoryOne of the youngest races, Humans appeared during the middle of the Cataclysmic Age and began settling the vales of the western lands. They were primitive, with almost no unifying language or customs. Each tribe was different and fought with the others for territory. Completely unaware of the history before their time the humans slowly developed nations through wars and conquest. The other races defeated them time and again, but they simply bred more children and with their inevitable superior numbers scraped out several empires. They connived and manipulated as they grew more sophisticated. Soon instead of using their own soldiers they were hiring mercenaries and brokering backdoor deals and using diplomacy. After the invasion of the Scourge they managed to hammer together a semi permanent alliance called the Unity. Official Saloan time is measured in Before Unity and After Unity and this is a direct result of the accords written by human scribes and lawgivers after the allied armies of Trolls, Orcs, Elves and Humans defeated the Undead Hordes.",

    "elf": {
        "name": "Elf",
        "desc": "Elves The species family of Faerie are perhaps best known for the sub-race Elves whose beauty and artworks are rivaled by none. The long lived Elves are masters of song, woodcraft and archery and few others become as adept with magic weaving as their Elders. They love their cousins the pixies and often can be seen in the company of halflings and centaurs. Dwarves on the other hand they revile as much as Orcs and Trolls. They tend to appear to be secretive, unfeeling and enigmatic and are seldom seen in large groups. It is the Elven cities that poets often write about when they wax prosaically about beauty and design. Elven cities are almost entirely crafted from woods they cultivate and are often indistinguishable from the forest they are embedded within. Thus leading to the myths about Elven settlements hidden by a veil of mystical power. Many a traveler has gotten hopelessly lost trying to find the cities of the Fae ones. Cold Elven laughter echoing in their ears the entire time has led more than one to go mad in grief and frustration. Appearance Slightly built, and shorter on average than humans, Elves are haughty in appearance with their arched eyebrows and pointed ears. They have (as all Faerie races do) eyes with only irises and pupils showing. Their eye-color ranges from deepest violet to light silver. Their hair tends to be either very dark or platinum. Their skin tone varies from tawny brown to pale snow in hue. Often separate Elven clans will look nothing alike. They trade heavily with other races so the materials of their artifacts and clothing are diverse as are the style and decorations. History Elves are one of the eldest of the races. As such their histories are lengthy and detailed, (almost tediously so). However no one, not an elf, would be able to read them as they are exclusively written in Hindaric, an ancient dialect of Faerie. The races of Faerie were once one race that split off during a great Diaspora fleeing the carnage of the ancient wars. 'DragonKing' is a dirty word in all Elven dialects now as they blame the most ancient and powerful race (they know of) for the ruination of their unity and lifestyles. Once Faerie were a favored people who ruled over the lesser children of Saloa with a benevolent if firm grip. Then the Oricinian corruption drove some to revolt and the hideous bloodshed began in earnest. The Drow another faction of Faerie were the worst offenders and the wars between elf and Drow elf clans became legends. After the Diaspora, the Drow were no where to be found. No one knows where they have gone but prophecies say they will someday return to wreak harm among the Fae. In more modern times Elves have begun withdrawing from interactions with the other races. They now kill intruders in their forests rather than simply lead them astray and are rarely seen in large groups unless its a war-band hunting Orcs, Dwarves or other enemies. Halflings, Gelflings and pixies are still welcome in their demesnes and some Elvish cities have a large population of both but for the most part they've become isolationists and intolerant of outside influences. This doesn't hold true with their trade outposts which are far more cosmopolitan and friendly places to visit.",
        "gen": "The Elves are a race of majesty and magic.  They are one of the most intelligent and magically inclined of the many sentient races of Myzan.  Able to learn and wield nearly any magic line, Elves are praised throughout the land as mighty sages, priests, and healers.  They have exceptional hearing and eyesight, and their reflexes are generally five times better than even the fittest humans, qualities that make their archers and scouts masters at their crafts.  Elves, however, are peaceful creatures.  They have long been guardians the forests, and the woodland creatures within them, as well as faithful allies to the humans of Myzan.  In fact, much of the Elven population has integrated in with humanity, their wisdom, magic, and good will becoming a very important part of the frail fabric of daily life that holds the Myzanese social order together.",

Slightly taller and somewhat leaner than the average man, elves look very much like humans with pointed ears thinner eyebrows.  Their eyes are often light shades of blues and greens, comforting and knowledgeable, and able to clearly pinpoint even small creatures in the thick bush from great distances.  Their hair is often worn long and loose or short and elegant, ranging in color from blond to sensual purples.    Elves are very sensitive to mana and nature, and, thus, are not generally very strong physically.  However, they are superb casters, healers, and druids and their strong sense of sight and hearing make them worthy archers and rouges.  As creatures of the forest themselves, it is not uncommon to find an elf surrounded by woodland creatures when the forests, or ever accompanied by a trusted pet.",
        "hist": "Unfortunately, just as humanity is torn between two warring factions over the kingship of Myzan, the Elves too are disjointed over the fate of the Myzanese throne.  There are tribes that support Victor Ramirez and his new order of the Society; there are those who wish to uphold the age old pact the Elves made with the Kings of Old Myzan, an ancient pact that requires elvish support to the rightful line of Myzanese kings, the now exiled house of Osguard.    This division has lead to much bloodshed and violence on both sides by both races, human and elf alike.  In the forests of Knotwood Valley, once the peaceful native home to the Elven-kind, a fierce resistance movement has surfaced, headed by the valiant Valrond of Northglen.  A direct descendent of Valmont the Wise, legendary co-signer of the Elvish pact with Men, Valrond, inspired by his heritage, has gathered a few of the most faithful elves to the pact and has lead them against those who would have the society reign supreme.  Indeed, many leaves have had to bear the spilled blood of slain elves and men.  Whether or not the efforts of Valrond and his resistance help turn the tide of war in the Exiles' favor, comfort for those true to the ways of old can be taken in that there are still faithful Elves ready to come to the aid of their allies, and their friends."

    "orc": {
        "name": "Orc",
        "desc": "Orcs A misunderstood species if there ever was one, Orcs, (savage seeming to some), are quite sophisticated in the context of their own society. They organize in tribes and intertribal rivalry is often fiercely bloody but usually in accordance with a complex and ancient code of rituals. Orc males and females alike each vie for places of honor within their tribes as they come of age by overcoming trials set by their elders. The traits Orcs cherish highly in their champions are wisdom, strength and cunning. Their tests are often grueling and debilitating. There are those Orcs who have become more \"civilized\" and they tend live apart from the Tribes in cities and have learned to do civilized things like eat with forks and read from books and shake hands instead of killing unwelcome strangers on sight. These Pariah are still short of what an urban Human for instance would expect or desire in a neighbor but they are a lot friendlier. The rumors of Orcs being cannibals is mostly hearsay. No historian has ever been able to prove this for a fact and some skeptics who are somewhat leary of such things dare ponder that this myth has been evolved by city Orcs who while enjoying city life don't want it to intrude on the secludedness of those they left behind. Others say Orcs aren't smart enough to make such a tale up so there must be some truth to it. Many a marriage between Orcs occurs after a victory over another tribe in which prisoners were captured. The ones who aren't eaten often become the spouses of the most successful warriors. The city Orcs tend to be freer in their commitments marrying anyone who strikes their fancy. Elf-Orc marriages aren't common but they have happened. No progeny so far have been reported from such unions. Appearance Orcs are green skinned humanoids with brutish features and often wear nothing but the tattoos of their adulthood. Their teeth are sharp and well suited to tearing flesh from bones. They walk upright but often slouch. Their tattoos done in bright pigments that match the forests/jungles where they live, are usually mystic symbols imploring their ancient war gods to protect them in battle. It is not uncommon for an Orc warrior to bear several large and (to humans) unsightly scars on their nearly naked bodies. The scars of battle are sacred to the orc. It is within battle most Orcs find their own sense of honor and purpose. They do wear cloths sometimes, ( especially in the cities because they know some of the other races fear their beautiful bodies and don't want to give their neighbors more reasons to complain). Otherwise when they dress in attire it is to fulfill some rite they don't understand or to arm for war. HistoryLong ago the Orcs were not so humble or savage. In fact quite the opposite was true. They were once one of the servitor races of the DragonKings and as such held a high status among the races. They were highly sought after as builders and while their ancient foes the Dwarves excelled at building under the surface, Orcs (aka Oricinians) built monumental pyramids that reached to the sky. Many of the ancient cities boasted Oricinian structures that amazed the eye and astounded the mind. Their gods were always bloodthirsty, however. Those who didn't worship their masters the DragonKings, worshipped dark spirits who led them to spurn their masters and eventually tear down their great edifices. There were many wars between good and evil, dark and light involving the Oricinians. Now no two modern historians agree about which side was which. The Oricinians once a mighty and proud people gradually slipped into depravity and savagery. This lead to their exodus from the cities to the jungles and forests of Saloa. They were led away by a revered leader named Monorgu the Blind. He slew all the priests of the war gods and proclaimed himself \"blind to the past.\" He prophecied a path for Orcs that has led them to their current state of living. Few Orcs can now place the whys and wherefore of their culture. Most believe fervently that their way has always been The Way. How they reconcile their constant warfare with other tribes is most puzzling, but they do.",

Clan social structure is often misunderstood by other races.  Many find it difficult to believe that honor is very important to an orc.    Orcs value strength and skill of arms over money, intelligence, and magic though, orc lords often possess those things also.  The lowest ranks are often filled by the thieves, magic users, farmers and the like.  These are known as \"Uhga\" within the clans and, while despised, they are tolerated because they are necessary.",

        "hist": "Deep within the hearts of human kind lives a hatred for their own weak bodies.  An ancient text reveals the existence of a cult of a cruel god that feeds of self-hate.  It is said that the worship of this god changed a large group of his followers.  As they sank deeper and deeper into this worship their skin began to change into putrid colors, they grew tusks and became increasingly hideous.  Though these changes made them outcasts, their bodies became stronger and they developed immunities to some of the diseases that killed many humans.  Although they loved their new changes, they became social outcasts from civilized cities.  Humans began to hunt this cult until a wise king saw that the orcs were beginning to become stronger than Myzan's armies could handle.  The constant battle turned this race into strict warriors.  Although tension still exists between the people,  the bridges of peace are beginning to be built."

They tend to have mixed traits of both Faerie and human ancestors and often live among other races. They are more outgoing and practical than Elves and more creative than humans. Note that they aren't Half Elves as some have mistakenly called them. Half Elves are Elven and Human and are usually only one or two generations removed from their ancestors. Gelflings are highly magical and are deep attuned to the earth of Saloa. They are the best farmers and healers because of this. They are known for their orders of Druids who can change shapes at will to those of other races and species of animal. Where Elves seem removed from the world, and Pixies too frivolous, Gelflings tend to be pragmatic, forward thinking and willing to adapt. Appearance Tall among the Faerie races Gelflings often grow to be over 6 feet tall. They have human eyes and skin colors but their hair tends to be sky blue or green or pale orange-gold. They have great singing voices and their racial songs have been known to soothe the savage beast. As they live among humans, dwarves, centaurs and others they tend to dress whichever style seems most appropriate for the culture they adopt. HistoryWhen the Faerie Diaspora took place, Gelflings stayed put in the cities and watched the Oricinian revolt. They took neither side continuing to care for the earth and feed the cities. They suffered some from the cruel misplaced wrath of the dying DragonKings but they survived and prospered. They lived through the cataclysms and plagues that followed the fall of the DragonKings and when the Humans took over most of the cities the Gelflings lived along side them strong in their earth magic and their ability to adapt. Gelflings have weathered every great war never taking sides unless their own homes and farms were threatened directly. They have never had any aspirations to conquer or control others and generally are more interested in feeding their families than getting involved in politics. Of course for every rule there is an exception and during the age of Upheaval that occurred after the Cataclysmic Age a Gelfling named Oromon Bearshaped, gathered an army of ragtag peasants and bandits and overthrew the local human ruler of Dumin Village and made the town a fortified base for Gelflings while he lived. Not many Gelflings flocked there but those that did form the towns current ancestors. To this day the locals of Dumin village proudly tell the tale of their brave ancestor. In the town hall hangs the Hammer Of Oromon, a relic of legendary power. It has been said that a Gelfling shall arise to own this hammer yet again, wielding it against future oppressors. Since the town has been prosperous since the day of liberation no one expects this to happen anytime soon."

Their love of food has led them to develop strong cultivation and culinary skills. Rare is a Halfling home without a garden full of vegetables, and pot of some kind of savory stew cooking on the stove. Halfling houses are often built on the sides of hills and extend under the earth. Halfling homes tend to be cozy and well lived in. They are friendly with most other people they encounter and have legendary hospitality customs. Halflings while a peaceful and domestically oriented race are quite capable of waging war and have done so effectively so much that other races rarely underestimate them anymore. AppearanceShort by human standards, Halflings stand as tall at full growth as eight year old human children. They tend to have curly brown or light brown hair and fair complexions. They speak with a bit of a brogue but their language is very similar to humans. They tend to dress for warmth and comfort, but never wear shoes on their large hairy feet. They tend towards plumpness as Halflings, one and all, enjoy a savoring good meal more than almost anything else. Halfling tend to have blue or green eyes with some rare ones having violet or brown hues. Because of their small stature they tend to wield small weapons. Usually, only elderly Halflings have beards. They tend to live over one hundred years and well into a hundred fifty years in some cases.HistoryHalflings are called such by their human neighbors as they seem like half men to the \"Biguns.\" They are not, however. They are a distinct race that has been in the western lands for longer than history records. They've always been burrowers and their holes have become gigantic warrens under the hills of many halfling towns. Unlike their human neighbors halflings aren't traders by choice, only occasionally using commerce to get what their settlements need. When humans first came conquering in the western lands Halflings had to fight them off constantly, and developed great skills of warfare. Not as orderly as Lemurians, Halflings still tend to be group oriented. And they are great at organizing defenses involving many different people. Their penchant for hiding is also legendary and some say it comes from the days when DragonKings actively hunted them and slew them for pleasure. Halflings were by and large able to escape the DragonKings's wrath with their stealthy ways and having a habit of making multiple escape routes from their hill holes. Such legends are merely tales now told to Halfling children to get them to obey. Most halflings are glad to accept that such beings as DragonKings never really existed. However they are still trained early to be capable of rendering themselves virtually invisible to the \"Biguns\" at a moment's notice.",

Long ago the Halflings were united into one large tribe.  They were very happy with the way things were and their settlement grew and grew.  Eventually, the Halflings grew to hate the large settlement.  Many thought it was much too crowded, others thought it was too noisy, some thought it was too busy and a few thought that the settlement was just too smelly.    The Halflings that thought the settlement was too large scattered into small bands and set up settlements in secluded places.  Those who wanted peace and quiet settled near the rivers.  They found that the rhythmic noises comforted them and they were the first and only Halflings to build boats.  Those who wanted a slow relaxed life decided to become farmers and support the other settlements, so these Halflings never settled together.  The Halflings that thought the settlement too smelly scattered whimsically across the lands of Myzan looking for fields of flowers and peaceful forests to settle in.  Sadly, most of these Halflings didn't survive their exploration as they neglected common sense and went into dangerous lands without weapons or food."

        "desc": "LemuriansSome called them angels, others refer to them as devils. Neither is the truth. They are aloof and forbidding and some of their most powerful members have seemed either beatific or diabolical depending on the point of view of the onlooker, however they are merely long lived humanoids. They tend to be very orderly and disdain disorganized, impulsive and chaotic people. At designated times of each year they have a festival where they act downright odd for their culture, deliberately covering themselves in mud, dirt, and wearing discarded clothes, drinking and debauching. During this time a Lemurian can be found doing just about anything. There are small sects among them who behave like this all the time but they are outcast and shunned by other Lemurians. Among those of other races, Lemurians are often known as meddlers as they tend to get involved in politics where they go. It is a rare court without a Lemurian advisor seated somewhere nearby. Appearance Small-winged, and tall-bodied with sparse hair and light eyes, Lemurians tend to appear austere and noble. Their eyes are normally sky-blue with a few showing hues pale green or light grey-brown. They vary slightly in skin tones from a light mottled brown to very slightly tanned. Their hair is either golden or black, though many youths dye theirs to be brown which is the modern thing to do to indicate the discarding of the old castes. The oddest thing about Lemurians from a humanish point of view are their pearly white horns that grow from tiny nubs (mostly among the female population) to the size of Elk antlers (the eldest of males). As a Lemurian ages their horns grow slowly. A horn-less male is considered to be outside of the society, a non Lemurian and is treated as such. Not shunned but not included either. The tiny bits of color and designs of the embroidery on the hems of their white linen robes usually indicates their house, caste (if any) and religion. History The Lemurians with the aid of Dwarven allies built great cities in the skies before the DragonKings dominated Saloa. During that terrible time they remained free and unconquered but at a price. They lost many people and almost stopped being able to reproduce due to energies spent fighting off the depredations of the marauding DragonKings. They were the ones who finally organized the revolt of the slave races that signaled the end of the Age of Dragons leading into the Cataclysmic Age. After the crash of their capitol city Lemuros, many Lemurians fled to the western lands and built what is now called the floating city. A great wonder of the modern world, it is but a small reflection of the lost magnificence of Lemuros, the city of angels. Many an explorer/archeologist has spent their life searching for the crash site of the ruined city. No one can say what magic caused their cities to crash but it doesn't affect those they've built since and since they fled to the western lands they have become more fecund though they are still far fewer in number than many of the younger races. In recent times some Lemurian philosophers, professors of behavior, and elders have decided that the old caste system doesn't represent the most logical of orders and instead have promoted a meritocracy. Many of the older houses oppose this idea and consider it blasphemous. Currently Lemurian society is in crisis, however Lemurians who love order above most other things will resolve this dilemma peacefully sooner than later. An order of Lemurian Healer priests have risen up and declared themselves \"disorderlies\" which in an ironic twist is well organized and effectively equipped to complete their mission which is to heal any and all who need healing. They travel the countryside healing anyone who asks or is in apparent need (sometimes against their wishes) and charge only enough to sustain themselves to their next meal. As a result in some cities a sub-sect of beggar-healers have started appearing. They tend to wear signs like \"Will heal you for a meal\" and \"Healer needs a home, will work for food.\" JobsLemurians are natural mages and healers. Their affinity with magic is only rivaled by Gorgons. They are also very scholarly and tend to organize their knowledge into schools which they teach their young. They have developed a special magic to defend themselves with when they haven't yet learned elemental magic. This magic while not very powerful does serve to keep most predators at bay. As such even those who don't pursue the Art have some grounding in it. Lemurians seldom develop strong physical fighter types but those who do emerge often choose to be Friars for their healing ability. A drunk disorderly Lemurian Friar is a fright to behold. Those monks have been known to pick fights one on one with Ice trolls and walk away unscathed. Their uncanny ability to fight while drunk lets them avoid the most egregious blows or shrug them off in an alcoholic daze. While the legends and heroes of old Lemuros were mostly mages and healers there are quite a few stories about Lemurian crafters that the old wives tell the babies. Lemurian crafters range from farmers to cooks to weavers and planters. They are also known to occasionally dabble in husbandry and breeding as well.",

Even the brightest and most kind hearted Troll teacher carries at least a cudgel with which to impart their well intentioned lessons. Trolls ever dominated by others have still learned to fight from birth to celebrate life's gifts. No gift is worthy unless it is properly fought over. No relative is truly loved until you've beat him about the head with all your might. A Troll healer's gift is painful medicine indeed ... but usually effective nonetheless. Trolls may seem civilized at times until one examines their habits. They eat their dung, use it to build with and generally wear it for most occasions.

They bleed a dark green too. They have sharp teeth for ripping meat but lack the fangs of their cousins, the Orcs. Like their cousins Trolls are often covered in tattoos. This art is often mystical and not merely social as Orcish tattoos are. Trolls usually have a horde of flies following them around and resting on them as they often wear bits of their dung which is also a dark smelly green. Their ears are quite pointed and they tend to have little hair on their heads. History Trolls have long been suspected of being a crossbreed of Orc and Elf, by certain scholars. No Elf would ever admit to this but there is truth in the matter. In the very last days of the DragonKings there existed a group of insane scientists who were bent on making a weapon in the form of a virus to kill their hated enemies, the lesser races. They captured various specimens of existing races and bred them together to get desired results. Then they planned to use these breeds to bring contagion to the other races.  Instead what took place is that several of their experimental breeds broke loose from their prison, killing their captors in a frenzied attack and fled into the wilds. These experiments were found by an Orc Tribe and given shelter and eventually they became a part of the tribe. Instead of killing those who came in contact with them the diseases altered them.  After several generations the diseases had caused such dramatic changes that the tribe no longer was Orcish and instead began behaving as modern Trolls. After a thousand years of breeding they were the same as Trolls are now. Trolls have fought a lot of wars for no reason but that they wanted a good fight with someone they perceived as stronger or wealthier. Unfortunately for them they have often been on the losing end of such conflicts as they don't have enough intellectuals to work out good long term strategies. They prefer the headlong charge or maybe at their most cunning a simple ambush to more complex maneuvering. They use armor and weapons haphazardly but with no particular plan. While they breed mighty warriors, most are unskilled any but the most basic of martial training. Thus they start wars but often end up not being able to finish them satisfactorily. One such conflict led to the depopulation of their tribes and enslavement for many years by the Elves, a now revered and respected foe. Other clashes involving first The Scourge and then their cousins the Orcs have occurred more recently but they've become closer allies with the Orcs in the last 200 years or so since then. After they were freed by the Elves, those Trolls who were enslaved founded Sevaw City on the southern coast of the western lands. They are still as savage as ever but now they have adopted some of the more \"civilized\" habits of other races, such as using buildings for shelter and trading for things they need instead of simply attempting to take it. It maybe that soon the Troll nation will again feel the need to stretch its muscles and against the advice of allies attack someone they can't possibly win against. Jobs Trolls are excellent Savages. Provided the job doesn't require much thinking they are happy to do it. Anything involving bashing someone's head in is a great days work well done. Give them a club and point them at an enemy and they will be content. Some few choose other physical professions especially Close combat and Warrior. There are almost no Troll Paladins and they tend to not be good soldiers due to a lack of discipline and the likelihood of shooting themselves with the complicated gunne-things. A troll mage would be a marvel indeed as most trolls hate thinking things through with a passion. Not that some aren't bright enough but they simply have low aptitude for it. Occasionally, a troll gets interested in healing largely because they want to heal the wounds of their enemies so they can bash them again. When this happens they go find a healer in some city run by another race. Trolls occasionally do work as masons or quarriers or smiths apprentices because they are strong and large and people mistakenly sometimes assume they can carry tasks through. This doesn't happen much but some Trolls actually excel at crafting things and become quite proficient in nonviolent skills. This rare happening can be mostly attributed to recessive Elvish blood, though no one would admit to that. In ancient trollish the phrase \"You bleed like an Elf\" used to be fighting words. Now its a backhanded compliment as most trolls don't know whether to fear elves or admire them.",

The Trolls have a    rugged type of civilization and society and like to believe that they have evolved past that kind of behavior.

    "pixie": {

        "desc": "Pixies One of the smallest members of the species Faerie, pixies make up for their stature with amazing nimbleness, a great sense of humor and a knack for practical jokes paralleled by none. They love hanging out with Centaurs and Elves, and Halflings and are immensely curious about Humans. Pixie curiosity is what drives their sense of humor and often gets them into tight squeezes that their charm has to get them out of. Pixies tend to be the most well adjusted of the younger races. They rarely ever go to war and while they make fierce warriors and mages they prefer the ways of stealth. They don't have a very good sense of property or ownership as their dialect of Faerie has no words to describe this concept properly. Pixies most closely embody the word \"play\" and resemble to the casual observer, tiny elf children with wings, especially when there is a group of them. Appearance Most pixies are about as tall as a human forearm is long and tend to be lithe no matter how much they eat. Their hair color most readily makes them recognizable, ranging from purple to green to flaming red. Their gemlike eyes glow in hues from amber to blue. They love to wear interesting things and don't care about fashion or things fitting correctly. They are immodest so it is not uncommon for a pixie to be inappropriately clothed, especially after a nights debauchery. History When the five races of Faerie departed from each other and left on the Diaspora that signaled the beginning of the Cataclysmic age, the Pixies were left to fend for themselves. Many died before a great leader arose among them. This leader, Darrion the Courageous, was most unpixielike (being both a paladin and hunter). He led a small band of pixie warriors known as the Rabble, and together they forged a path from their homelands to the western plains fighting untold horrors and armies of other races. Never before have the Pixies produced such a hero, but in generations since his time there has always been someone whose name starts with Darr who arises in times of need and saves the race from eminent peril. Strangely its always a descendant of the first Darrion. In recent times the pixies have learned to survive by becoming very stealthy and learning the ways of the shadows. Equally at home in city or country, a pixie can be counted on to know the quickest way to disappear in either environment. They have traditionally been guides and tamers for humans and elves, often liaising between the two sometimes warring races. A few years ago a sect of pixies living in the northern regions of the western lands broke off from their brethren and set up a secret enclave. Rumors have flown ever since about them. They are known as the Shadow Priests, which begs the question: what are they worshipping? And what is their purpose? Murders of prominent members of towns in that region have been attributed to this group of never seen pixies. Whether these rumors are true or false remains to be seen however evidence points to the rise of a dark corrupting influence among them. Also troubling is an increased intolerance towards pixies among the humanish populace. Occasionally townsfolk have strung up the mostly harmless pranksters and left them to die. This seems like a time of great trouble for the smallest Faerie race.",

Though they are basically shy creatures with a playful attitude, the pixies will protect themselves as many have discovered."

Both enclaves live in the center of the Underground Realm and are constantly struggling for dominance through intrigue and influence. They seldom fight directly.Appearance Tall among humans and elves, they resemble the other races greatly with the same variations in hair and eye color and skin tones except that they are pale, and have bloodshot eyes.

They often use glamours to enhance their appearance and scent so that even when starving they seem regal and comely. Their ability to charm the naive is legendary. History From the beginning of human history there have been those who follow the light and those who choose darkness instead. Most humans have followed neither and have lived content to worship their own creations. In early times, among those who worshipped the darkness, there arose a tribe of warriors so strong few could defeat them in battle. The Powers of Darkness smiled upon them and bestowed them with great gifts and in return the dark warriors who called themselves Emratu Ledenia (Blood of Darkness) sacrificed their victims village by village and terror reigned among the human domains they controlled. As their victories grew and their bloodlust remained the Dark Powers increased their powers and at the same time took from them their humanity. Slowly the Emratu became takers of the life force and with their increased strength and power to fly and withstand elements normal humans could not they became even mightier. However their affinity with the dark came with a price. They could no longer abide the light of the suns. Their very life giving rays burned the warriors and made them weak. The Emratu grew to be extremely long lived but reproduced rarely and eventually they discovered they could no long reproduce as humans do. Instead they had to perform dark rituals to their Gods and convert a living human to one of them through sacrificial blood exchanges. Another price was that they no longer lived as normal men do. They could breath if they wished. Or not. But they could no longer ingest food for nourishment. Instead they had to subsist solely off the life-force they could suck from others. At the very zenith of their debauchery they were brought low by a clan of Paladins of the Light whose army consisted of thousands of fervent Sun-Worshipers and priests. Defeat after defeat they suffered, slowly losing member after member against tremendous forces.  Their leader prayed to the Great Darkness, their highest ranked God to deliver them from defeat. During the battle at the citadel in which they tried to storm the Dwarven fortress they were about to be overcome and finally destroyed the earth trembled and shook mightily. The night sky full of stars and moonlight grew black and lightning bolts struck out randomly among both the allied human forces and the remaining Emratu. A Pitch-black miasma lay over the battlefield through which no light could be seen.  The whole area fell silent except for the screams of the dying and the those struck with lightning. The earth shaking lasted for seemingly hours and yet when it was over and the darkness lifted the stars had barely changed position. Gone were the Emratu, the Dwarven citadel and all the armies fighting inside it. Those armies outside were left surrounding a barren scorched earth. The Emratu were not destroyed as some scholars of that time foolishly suggested. The citadel sank under the earth of Saloa and came to rest in the Underground Realms. The dark warriors quickly overcame the remaining dwarves who survived the cataclysmic fall and took them prisoner for food sources. The Underground Realm was no easy fertile place to live. Powerful ancient races lived there. Yealks and Waithes both peaceful with each other for thousands of years immensely resented the intrusion into their territory. The ruins of the citadel fell directly on sacred grounds for them, so they gathered their forces and drove the Emratu out, pursuing them until the Emratu fled across the lava flows into what is now Balane Town. With the Emratu slowly dying out they started making more and more lesser spawns. These sired \"Vampires\" became their servitors. Soon they had a horde of minions. Eventually the Emratu splintered into sects and stopped acting as a tribe. They built shrines to their dark gods and worshipped them but no longer did they treat each other with brotherly respect or admiration. A sect of Vampires as the Emratu became more widely known as broke away from the other sects and began to fight the dark powers. They stopped feeding off of higher life-forms' life-force, scavenging nourishment in plant life and insects. They stopped using their abilities to hurt others and instead began to nurture those around them. After a pitched battle that culminated from discovery by the other sects of their secret, The Enlightened fled to what is now known as the Crypts of Decrin. Decrin was their first leader and a great teacher. He was quite knowledgeable in how to fight other Vampires. His lore combined with the wisdom of his followers helped to make the Crypts a place where The Enlightened might gather in peace, and make plans for how to end the blight of their cursed brethren. Jobs Vampires are diverse and choose careers based on personal interests or on the interests of their sires. Many become Warriors of the Scourge, and learn the various arts of weapon use. Some few are chosen by the Elders as Noblemen to lead their brethren. Others yet become mercenary Archers, Minstrels, Close Combats for the Ganorishissi. Vampires are generally not terribly bright but they are immensely powerful in magic. Thus many become Necromancers, Healers, and Mages. They don't have any formal system of learning these things but necromancy is an art that comes naturally to them through their connection to the dark powers. Some few become Friars and Paladins of the Deity or the Darkclan. Typically most vampire Necromancers are members of The Deity sect, though some have joined the Darkclan or less pure clans. While crafter vampires are very possible they are not encouraged among the sects as they don't directly contribute to conquest. The whole mindset of the vampire is not patient enough to really encompass what it takes to be a good crafter. However among the Enlightened there are some who do find redemption in the simple act of creation. It symbolizes for them defiance of their creators and the Dark Gods.",

They have an unnatural thirst for things living to be turned into things dead… or undead. They live on the blood of other living things, from Humans to little woodland creatures. They are sentient beings, for all that they live off of the blood of living beings. Vampires tend to frequent places where humans gather in large quantities, allowing them to pick off a few from the crowd without the person being noticed for a while. Vampires are extremely strong and agile, allowing even the weakest to overpower a full-grown man or out-run a trained sprinter. Vampires can be killed by a stake to the heart, but so can almost anything else. Vampires are no different in that respect. There are few abnormal ways to kill them. If their heads becomes severed from their shoulders, they will most certainly perish, just like anything else. Prolonged exposure to sunlight will not kill them, but will injure them greatly…. or at least make them weak.  Vampires defend their own, and sometime live in conclaves, with one overall leader. An unwary adventurer will quickly become a late morning snack or find themselves as yet another member of the Reaper horde.",

Oh, he had the ability to bend all sorts of creatures to his will, but those who are enslaved tend to resent such treatment. He was also paranoid enough that just putting up a job offer for help was not an option.    So, he did what he did best. He sat down with his tomes of magic and set about the task of creating an automaton that would never tire, complain or think on its own. After many sleepless nights spent gathering the correct materials and inscribing components with runes, he was ready. Just before he began incanting, though, a thought occurred to him. The creature he was about to create was going to be none too smart. What if something happened to it through its own stupidity? He would like to be able to create another one easily without all the hassle involved in this first endeavor. So, he crafted another part of the spell, a shining, magical mirror that would let him duplicate his spell.    This is where things took a turn for the worse. The poor mage got one, tiny part of the inscriptions upon the mirror wrong. So, when it came time for him to replace his first golem, he found that he could not shut the mirror down. Suddenly, golem after golem appeared in his tiny home. Realizing that he had to get them out of his house before they destroyed it, he started giving them random tasks, just to get them out of the way while he could try to think of a way to stop the flow of golems. This golem he sent to pick apples. That one he told to walk westward and not stop. Another, he sent snipe hunting. And so it went on and on…    No one is certain what the mage did with the mirror but, considering the number of golems that still exist, people speculate that he was never able to turn it off."

Most of this energy is released as shock waves as the continental plates suddenly release and slide along one another. However, that is sometimes not the only release. Every so often, there are pockets of magical energy trapped within the plates along the fault lines. When the earth finally releases, sending energy ripping through the land, part of that energy mixes with the magic of the world. Earth and magic combine, swelling into a mind-numbing crescendo of light and sound that echoes the tremors of the earth itself….and an elemental is born.    Because of an elemental's ties to nature, each one is different from the others. Those born of earthquakes are dark, slow to anger and as patient as stone. Those born of tsunamis combine the patience of earth with the powerful grace of the ocean.

They seem to cross some attributes of fish with those of mammals having very human looking faces and bodies that seem to support live births but infact they lay eggs which they hatch in clutches in secret underwater grottos. Their language is based on being in water so its very difficult to communicate with them on land. They depend alot on water currents and temperature to vary the inflections and intonations of their words. Some naturalists suggest they have very weak mental magic that lets them communicate mind to mind while in water but no evidence supports this theory at all. What is more the frustrating is no Watuman will ever confirm or deny it as it is in their culture an invasion of privacy to discuss such matters openly.HistoryUntil recently the Watuman were largely unaware and unconcerned with the surface dwelling races happy to play on the waves of their home without worry. This would still be the case, however recent events have forever changed this. A watuman elder seer was found assassinated in her shellhome with no apparent motive and no clues as to whom the murderer was except a peice of cloth grasped in her stiff hand that originated from the land dweller city of Ishtael. Outraged, the chief of her local school uncharacteristically called to arms his brethren and sisters to wage war on the surface dwellers. However, reason finally prevailed when the Great Council of the many schools met to discuss the gravity of this situation. Upon reaching a concensus, the peaceful Watuman decided on a diplomatic mission to investigate this death. Their delegation was warmly met by members of the newly formed Unity council.Upon the conclusion of a dangerous and potentially earthshattering investigation the Unity's Special Ops & Hunter Division was able to apprehend and destroy the cabal of evil doers known simply as the Iron Band, whose members while responsible for the murder were also involved with numerous other criminal enterprises geared towards causing war and strife in the lands. The decision was reached by the Unity Council to invite the Watuman to join their ranks and so the peaceful Watuman have become embroiled in the politics of the surface and their future will never be the same again. As more and more Watuman take brief sojourns to the surface more have been captured by slavers who sell them as pets to calloused tamers and zoo owners. This problem has become a major concern for the Watuman diplomatic delegation as school members seeking lost brothers and sisters have put pressure on them to produce results. Some people fear that Watuman influence on the Unity council will lead to trade reforms including the outlawing of enslavement of intelligent species.",

Still, there are many races in Myzan who would prefer to either avoid where they live or eliminate this race altogether.

He then found that rabbits are more reactive to the mixtures. In fact, they were quite sensitive to them. He continued to work with rabbits, believing that this will hasten the fruits of his experiments. Though he came near creating the ultimate growing elixir, the rabbits have grown too huge and gigantic to be contained. They started to run rampant in the village that the villagers of Springlade begged him to stop. At first, the alchemist would not hear their plea until a pretty girl commented on how his height is actually perfect. He then agreed to stop the experiments, figuring out that the elixir cannot really work on humanoids.

They gather in moots to decide what is good for all of the tribe and what great works need doing. Dwarven craftmasters meld stone and metal and wood with their clever artifice to make ingenious machines that astound the other races. Dwarven warriors wearing ancient mythril armors and bearing large two handed keenedged axes are perhaps the most fearsome sight to many a foe but the dwarven Soldier with a gunne in hand is definitely one of the most lethal. AppearanceShort, gnarled, longbearded and stocky, the average male dwarf has rock like skin, (varying in shades and tones from light marble to a deep burned sandstone) and a sonerous voice. The females, less frequently seen, have slighter builds but are just as tall and strong and their skin tones tend to have more gem qualities. They too have deep voices but despite rumours to the contrary don't wear their beards long. HistoryLong ago when the mountains were but hills and volcanos lived and died in but a single seasons breadth the dwarves appeared. No historian can accurately place their advent into Saloa, but since then they have often been cause for comment. It was the axes and guns of the dwarven nation that staved off the worst of the dragon's attacks during the first Dragon Conquest. Dwarves have long been a mercantile race and often have sold their services and crafts to the other \"less able\" races in exchange for things they don't make well. During the first settling of the western lands the dwarves of the Cold Rock mountains settled in Vaal town amidst the lavaflows. Soon humans and other races settled there too and a mercantile town was born. Today's dwarf is versatile and ready for almost any challenge but most opt to become craftsmen like their forebears. Recently there have been rumors of a prophecy of one who will emerge to become king among Dwarves and lead the nation to retake their former home now refered to as Hellhole. JobsDwarves have incredible stamina and strength. This makes them well suited towards swinging their great axes and also means they can make forced marches wearing their best and heaviest armors and still sing while fighting numbers far greater than their own. Beware the dwarven soldier, whose guns and cannons are able to take down foes many times their size and power. Though they arent the fastest or smartest of the races they make up for this with their enduring ability withstand damage and mete it out in massive proportions.",
        "gen": "Dwarves are short, fiery-tempered warriors, known for their toughness and durability. Among Myzan's fiercest fighters, the dwarves are without question the most irritable, quick to take (and give) offense.

Dwarven drinking and belching contests are extremely entertaining to watch, if you don't mind the risk to life and limb or going deaf for a few days afterwards. Dwarves have an uncompromising hatred for elves. This is not surprising since the tall, willowy, graceful elves are the polar opposite of the dwarven race.  According to folktale legend, this enmity between the two races started when the elves and dwarves first met each other. An elven tracker was scouting the woods when he stubbed his toe on what he thought was a small boulder. Being tired, he sat down upon the boulder and then, bored, began carving his initials into it. The boulder was actually a dwarf, who, taking exception to being treated this way, gave an angry bellow and threw the elf into a nearby tree. It is worth noting that this legend is probably untrue for the simple reason that dwarves snore so loudly a deaf troll could hear them from over a mile away.",
        "appr": "Dwarves are extremely short (about 3 1/2 - 4 feet in height) and because of this, some people underestimate them. It is foolish to take a dwarf lightly, however, because they are made up of nothing but solid muscle and bone, hard as the rock they were created from. A famous proverb states, “If you want to break your toe, go kick a dwarf.” Dwarves are extremely sensitive about their height and take great delight in pummeling those who look down on them. Dwarves prefer to live in caves and mines deep beneath the ground where they can search for the precious metals that are treasured by their race. The most striking difference between dwarven males and females is that most of the females don't have beards. They are similar in all other aspects though, particularly ferocity. The dwarven king, Olaf Hammerhead, once lamented to his court that it had been an entire week since he'd gotten into a good, jaw-breaking rumble. At this point Olan's wife leveled him with a left hook straight to the jaw and soon all present were swinging happily away at each other.",
        "hist": "Dwarves were created from the very bones of the mountains, and the first Myzanian dwarves lived exclusively in caves. Over time, though, many dwarves moved into more civilized regions, drawn by the allure of markets for the precious minerals they had stockpiled over the centuries. Despite a rocky start, the other races of Myzan soon got over the dwarves' surly dispositions and came to recognize how valuable they could be to associate with. And so the dwarves established themselves in the Myzanian community. Used as mercenaries because of their fierce fighting abilities and incredible stamina, and as miners because of their skill with stone, dwarves have quickly became indispensable to, if not popular with, the other races of Myzan."

The two possible exceptions to this hostility are the elves and the druids. Elves have always cared for the forests, as have the druids. The druids in addition, are caretakers of the forests and have slowed and, in some cases, reversed the destruction caused by those who would despoil the deep forest homes of the woodes.",

These limbs, while not as dexterous as a humanoid's arms, are incredibly strong and can tear apart an ox if the woode is sufficiently enraged. They are also much longer than a human's, making the woode a deadly foe at anything inside of crossbow range. Instead of two legs, the woode has a single trunk-like leg with roots at the bottom. These roots are incredibly strong and serve to pull the woode along, thus enabling the woode to move. To be sure, woodes do not move very fast, but with their long limbs they don't need to. In addition, woodes have extremely tough bark-like skin, susceptible to only the sharpest of weapons, like a good axe. Woodes are deathly afraid of fire, however, and will seek to flee from it if possible. Woodes are incredibly long-lived, with a life expectancy of up to thousands of years. Some of the older woodes are among the most ancient creatures of Myzan.",

One such expedition was led by a certain Lord Falstaff, cousin to the king. Having set out with a well-equipped team of 30 men, Falstaff returned alone 3 months later, bloodied, torn, and clearly out of his mind. Although he never recovered, Falstaff left behind a journal which provided some details of the ill-fated expedition. In it, Falstaff talked about how his team was ambushed one night by “…walking trees, that picked men up and ripped them apart or dashed them against boulders.” This upset the king so greatly that he ordered his army, bearing axes and torches, to descend on the forests and burn them to the ground. This they did indiscriminately, causing the destruction of much innocent plant and wildlife. Whole forests that had stood for thousands of years were burned to the ground or chopped up and thrown on bonfires. The army caught few of the actual woodes themselves, but succeeded in engendering such an intense anger in the hearts of their quarry that few dare to approach the ancient groves anymore. Indeed, men traveling through the ancient forests of Myzan face almost certain destruction at the hands of the woode population, who, old as they are, seldom forgive and never forget."

They live now most predominantly in the Valley of Wurms in the Underground Realm, and the desert surrounding the passage to the surface. They tend to be neutral towards strangers and treat all new comers distantly but with guarded respect. They no longer have the conquest fervor of their ancestors. Gorgons never wear any heavy armor because their scales are defense enough from most elements and natural weapons, and it would be seen as an admission of weakness to wear such material. Gorgons are a proud and stolid race, rarely displaying emotions but always noting slights and aggravations in private. Appearance Covered in shiny green scales and soft leathery skin, with snakes for hair, Gorgons are hard to look at without becoming stoned. Or so say the myths about them. This is mostly not true. A gorgon who breaths on you can paralyze you for a time but you wont be petrified. While females are most common, there are males who are distinguishable by their larger scales and slightly darker shades of green skin tones. They also have more masculine demeanors and tend to be more fashion conscious. They often dress to impress the females and their colorful attire is usually suited towards wooing new wives when they are in season. Gorgon eyes are uniformly brown/black, with snakelike nictating membranes. History Once this magical race was more numerous and lived peacefully on the surface but were driven underground by a unified army of Sithanu and Humans, who conquered the lands surrounding the oasis now known as Ishtael. Gorgons have been sworn enemies of the Sithanu ever since, and both races kill each other on sight whenever possible. The irony is that the Sithanu and Gorgons have common ancestors in the Ancient Ophidians. Back during the start of the Cataclysmic age the DragonKings who dominated the world in the first known age, were dying out and so bred themselves with lesser races to develop among others, the Ophidians. The Ophidians were snake like desert dwellers and lived apart from their progenitors and the other races. When the Oricinians began to worship the dark gods of War some Ophidians were corrupted as well as some of the Fae races. This led to the schism between the Gorgon and Sithanu. The Sithanu further changed as they bred themselves at the direct request of their Gods, with desert arachnids, becoming more warlike and vile.

They are known as the Gorgons, a semi-serpentine people of warriors and mages content to watch over the misty peaks they call home.

Even now the Gorgons hide sharp fangs in their mouths and cover intricate patterns of scales on their backs.  Their eyes are sharp, and their forked tongues can sense the air about them.  Some even slither about on serpentine hindquarters below their very human torsos.  The most identifiable attribute of a Gorgon, however, is its hair - locks of living snakes, or so it has been said.",

However, some believe that a wayward group among the Gorgons angered the serpent god they served, and as punishment, the entire race was cursed to suffer the lost of their former beauty forever, made to bare the attributes of the very god they worshipped.  To the mountains they fled, and defensive they became, ever content as days passed to be reclusive.    As time passed, and the Gorgons were passed from human memory, rumors spread concerning a vile witch of snakes in the mountains.  It was said that a evil creature with snakes for hair a stone stare lurked about the rocks and brush in search of a stray man to call all her own.  Such a hideous monster she became in the minds of men that parties were formed to hunt her.  They scoured the mountainsides and terrorized lone Gorgons from the realms of the Seven Sisters to the vales of Lakeview.    The witch hunt went on with seemingly no end in sight as the men failed to find the fantasized monster they sought.  Memory of the Gorgons slowly returned to the minds of men.  But tainted those memories were, overshadowed in influenced by the irrational fears of men.  Whatever evil vexed the Gorgons ages ago had surely driven them to threaten all mankind with the prospect of an eternity locked in stone.  The Gorgons became a race of fear - fear of men and the fear of men.    The end came with a brave soul, a lone Gorgon maid, forever touched by grief for her people.  She alone willingly offered herself as the vile villainess the hunters wanted.  They took her and put and end to their hunts, with her head as their trophy.  To this day, the Gorgons remember the sacrifice of that selfless maiden.  Forever will they honor Medusa."

However, if you look closely, you can almost make out two arms and maybe a long, featureless face within its misty form.    While it has no solid body to speak of, energy seems to caress the essence's shape, running along its form in waves that eventually rise upwards like flames to flicker and dance, even if there is no wind about. Were you to put your arm through the creature, it is uncertain whether you would feel a fire's heat, electricity's sting or nothing more than a cool, wetness as though you passed your hand through fog.",
        "hist": "Essences have been around for as long as Myzan has existed. They are creatures born of the very heart of the world, created from the remnants of the magic that made formed Myzan, itself.    When great artisans create their works, there is always a little bit of material left over. A stonemason grinds down a raw gem to create a jewel, and gem dust is left behind. A sculptor carves a statue from wood, leaving chips littering the floor at his feet. It was exactly the same when the gods created Myzan. There was a bit of life magic left over from their initial creation, and these bits became essences.    Now, many artists would clean up their work, brushing away leftovers so that their creation is pristine. The gods, however, looked down upon the essences and they smiled. These creatures were not “leftovers” but another form of life to add to the diversity of their creation. The gods sat and watched quietly as the essences stumbled about, at first, wandering aimlessly as they explored the world and stretched their senses. After awhile, the gods moved on to creating other forms of life, leaving the essences to grow into whatever they wished, just as they would leave all the races to their own devises.    And, what did the essences do? They grew in power and desire, seeking out sources of magic to add to their own. Oh, they do not gather magic to use as a wizard does. Instead, they seek magic to add to themselves, to consume like the finest of wines. Essences can often be found around ley lines, soaking up the magic in those mystical places, reveling in feeling the power course through their bodies."

        "name": "Werewolf",
        "desc": "Werewolves The menace in a werewolf's red glowing eyes in the dark of the night has sent chills down the most battle hardened combat veteran. Their shrieking howls have driven villagers mad with fear and loathing. They are not evil though people often confuse them as so. Theirs is a disease called lycanthropy that causes them to become bestial when the suns set. The hearts of most Werewolves are good. They tend to enjoy life to the fullest and expect others to as well. They are usually a bit naive concerning motives and thus are easy marks for the darker elements but they also learn from mistakes and use some common sense to judge new unfamiliar situations. Werewolf culture is direct and straightforward and so they may seem blunt and uncaring to those lacking in perception. They are sensitive to how others feel but they usually have a higher regard for the truth than other races. It is not uncommon for a Werewolf to greet friends and family with a howl and among males a smack. Then hugging ensues. This is particularly peculiar looking when they are all in man-wolf form. Appearance During the day werewolves look like humans with perhaps a touch more hair than you'd expect. However when the suns set their bodies change into nightmares. Their limbs lengthen and become over-muscled. Their hair grows out to a full coat of fur. Their head grows into the shape of a wolf's and their teeth lengthen. Usually their eyes glow in the dark and are red. Their skin hardens and becomes harder to pierce with normal weapons. Males tend to have more fur on the top of their head than females and their coats range from dark to light brown, while females tend to range from silver to violet-brown with rare ones being entirely covered in ebony fur. Werewolves tend to wear baggy loose-fitting clothing and almost never wear shoes opting for sandals when needed. They rarely get cold so they don't usually wear much more than modesty requires. History Folklore says that Werewolves are afflicted with a disease that can be passed to humans via their terrible bite. However this is not entirely true. They do have a disease called lycanthropy, which is magical in nature. A long time ago a village of human peasants was cursed by a mighty wizard with a nasty temper and a penchant for complicated curses. He felt insulted by their coarseness and lack of hospitality and the display of general disrespect the ignorant have for those obviously above them. So he set upon them a disease-like curse. It would infect all their descendants for all time until one among them was so good and pure that even gods themselves would bow to them in honor of their piety.  The curse invoked their inner beasts within to come forth and reign during their sleeping hours and not rest till the rays of the suns shone upon them. Life in the village went on as usual long after the cranky old man with the funny hat and sparkling robes left. Weeks passed. Then one night, during the light of the first full moon, the whole village changed. No one remembered a thing in the morning after but the wreckage was enough to scare them silly. All of their livestock was slaughtered and pets eaten or run off. Three nights in a row this happened before a young man of the village who was wiser than his neighbors decided to embark on a quest to find a sage to help them find the answer to the riddle of what was happening to them. When he finally found one who was willing to help he had already discovered some of the problems. He knew that he was becoming a half-man half-wolf and had no memories of his condition while he was like that. The sage who was also a mage of some note put the cursed fellow in chains and studied him for months. Sighing with exhaustion, the sage finally decided what needed to be done. He could find no way to lift the curse. It was crafted by an intellect far more schooled and experienced than his in Dwoemercraft, and specifically in the Art of The Hex. He could find no technique in all of his books that spoke of a method to lift the curse. However, he was able to devise a series of spells that would alter the curse so that the young man and his neighbors and descendants could live their normal lives with the curse and have some hope of someday ending it. His changes made the condition slightly less severe in the following ways: The Werewolves as he dubbed them would retain all of their cognitive abilities and would completely be able to control their bestial tendencies even during the full moon, but would still have to revert to the man-wolf shape at darkfall. They would develop an allergy and vulnerability to silver as a side effect of the casting. This part was unavoidable as the changes required a balancing price be paid. Soon after the spells were prepared and then cast, the young man returned home to his village. He found Kingsmen there when he arrived and a priest of the Sun gods overseeing a ritual of mass exorcism on almost the entire populace. He watched from afar in a high up tree as the priest frowned at last and with much angst and fretting, signaled to the Captain of the Kingsmen to kill them all.  He could do nothing for the villagers so he fled with his horse. He kept running from town to town avoiding authorities as they hunted him, until he learned that there was an underground realm where the suns never shone and apparently neither did the moon. The girl who informed him of this had fallen in love with him after finding out about his affliction and together they fled ahead of a posse into the caverns that lead to the underground. They chose to settle in the southern area of the then largely unexplored realm. They built a home on the tip of a pretty peninsula over looking an underground sea. They raised many fine children. Most of whom, married and built in the area and before long Bwael Che'el was founded. One of the oldest towns in the Underground Realm, the only werewolf town serves as a trade post for the whole realm. Some humans have recently come to accept that werewolves can be dealt with honorably but not all are so tolerant. There are some guilds who put a high bounty on werewolf fur, so no werewolf can feel perfectly secure outside of Bwael Che'el. Some slavers even go so far as to capture Werewolves underground and transport them to the surface where they can be sold to tanners who greedy for a profit, sheer them of their hides and sell the products to the Guilds posting the bounties. Needless to say this highly illegal activity is bound to garner retribution at some point. JobsWerewolves are natural fighters at night time able to rend opponents many times their size and walk away victorious. Many become close combatants because they learn through using their natural weaponry to not rely solely upon weapons. While still others cling to hope of being the one prophesied in the telling of the curse to be the one who redeems their race and thus devote themselves as Paladins serving the greater good. Many Werewolf savages have broken away from their brethren and now live in the wilds surrounding Bwael Che'el while still others have chosen the darker path of thievery. Being able to pass for human during daylight has caused some more daring Werewolves to venture into schools of the Art and enroll their children as students. Of course any wizard worthy of the name can see a werewolf as such but few schools mind this and merely keep the secret knowing some of their fiercest colleagues are also werewolves. Why those who are masters of the Art do not teach in the Underground Realm is a mystery to all but themselves.   Werewolf crafters tend to be quarrymen and Stonemasons as there are plenty of stones in the Underground Realm. Others still, become smiths or miners of gems and ores. Werewolves, by and large can be any profession a human can so you will find them in all fields and walks of life.",

Contrary to myth and legend, werewolves become essentially sentient wolves when the moon is at its highest point every night. Like their brethren, werewolves size up humans as living meals, or as potential fodder for the undead legions. Even as ‘human' as they get, werewolves still attempt to act like what they look like, even as they examine their newest meal or recruit.     As wolves, they are different than the woods variety. They walk on their hind legs when they feel like it. They also wear clothes, though a different style and material than they wear as humans. Werewolves also hunt in packs, just like wolves. There is an alpha male in each pack. This male rules the pack. Only through death will the alpha lose leadership. And they do not die easily.",
        "appr": "Werewolves, in their wolf-form, look like extremely large, bipedal wolves that might wear clothes and can speak coherent languages. However, there are differences.

Their muscles and claws are of large proportion to the normal wolves that exist in Myzan.",
        "hist": "Werewolves are only slightly younger in Myzan than any of the other Reapers. The other Reapers are slightly wary around them, for, compensating for their youth, werewolves are possibly the most vicious of the undead. Also, the other undead are covetous of the fact that the werewolves are the only Reapers who can actually walk around in daylight without being screamed at or attempted to be slaughtered by angry townsfolk. In the wars that have gone on in the history of Myzan, the werewolves have always been the second tier troops. They have always been sent for stealth operations, slaughtering enemy leaders in their sleep, destroying supplies, or just generally causing mayhem. The future of these creatures is quite evident: they will continue to grow in strength and power."

    "sithanu": {
        "name": "Sithanu",
        "desc": "Sithanu Evil, mean-spirited, violent, corrupt. All these words describe most Sithanu precisely. They often take delight in torturing others and have wicked ideas that make even the most harmless acts seem foul somehow.  While not considered particularly bright, Sithanu are ambitious and clever. They delight in objects of war and worship dark vile gods of Death, Destruction and War. Sithanu Deathpriests are infamous assassins who seek out and perform ritual murders against their enemies. They are almost universally feared among the other races. To be fair there are some who are not like this at all. Generally those few who survive, escape from Sithanu culture altogether and find other enclaves to disappear into. Those who do are polar opposites, kind, considerate, empathetic, often turning to healing to offset the horrors of their youth. Appearance Reptilian and fierce looking, Sithanu look every bit like the violent and bloody creatures that they are. They tend to have brown to greenish scales ranging in a gradient across their body. The more green the older the Sithanu. The eldest Sithanu (who are few) have many battle scars and their scales are often dark green turning gray. Long sharp claws, and a scorpion like tail added to their muscular physiques give them the appearance of natural born fighting machines and most are. Their eyes are invariably some shade of red with a snakes nictating membrane and a kind of looking everywhere at the same time stare. They have small sharp teeth meant for ripping flesh but their jaws do not open very wide so they don't often bite. Females have a crest over their heads that when they are angry flares out like a cobra's skin flaps making their heads look winged. Sithanu voices are raspy and irritating to listen to and they of course share the snakes sibilant tongue. History Once long ago a race of powerful beings rose up and conquered most of the other races. These DragonKings eventually ruled most of Saloa and built wondrous cities with the aid of their slave races.  Near the end of what is now known as the Age of Dragons, they started dying out. None among them could find out why or find a cure. When their slave races began revolting and the Oricinians began tearing down their greatest cities, some of the DragonKing scientists began a breeding program, attempting to find a crossbreed of their race and other species that could survive the changing climates and environments in Saloa. The Ophidians, a snakelike race, were their only truly successful attempt. However, the Ophidians were a peaceful race who only desired to be left alone and so did not keep their progenitor race's cultural values. The Ophidians lived in the desert where they could be comfortable and had a society of simple necessity. When the Oricinians began to worship the dark Gods, some of their wandering Templars found Ophidian villages and converted them through persuasion and cajolery and sometimes force. This created a schism between those Ophidians and the ones who didn't convert. The newly corrupted along with the Oricinian priests were chased out by the magics of the Ophidian elders and fled to other parts of the desert. Thus the Sithanu were born. The Sithanu became bloody-minded and depraved even by Oricinian standards and soon were universally reviled. Humans, who were a young emergent race seemed to find Sithanu useful and often hired them in groups to do mercenary work. When the Humans began empire building at the end of the Cataclysmic Age they gathered a huge army consisting of their own kind and Sithanu mercenaries and marched into Ophidian territory. By this time Sithanu had evolved into their present form through a series of breeding experiments with desert arachnids at the behest of their dark gods, while their long lost brethren evolved into Gorgons. The battle for Ishtael Oasis is legendary and was waged for many days but in the end the more numerous and lethally prepared army of Humans and Sithanu succeeded in driving out the remaining Gorgon populace to the underground realm and claimed the oasis-lake as their own. Ever since Sithanu and Gorgon have been sworn enemies. As the Human empire grew, the Sithanu mercenaries came to be treated with less regard and eventually were relegated to low level positions on the borderlands. Unhappy with this, the Sithanu warlords broke their allegiance with the Humans and began their own wars of conquest. Happily for the rest of the world, Sithanu rarely agree on anything of importance and so their most ambitious generals fought among each other until they were too weak to conquer much. Many of the written histories of the Sithanu depict their acts of treachery and bloodshed, however, some very good intentioned Sithanu heroes have existed and committed deeds of great renown. One such, a bardic rogue named The Red Sun (translated from Sithanu) scaled the walls of a fortress of evil Sith and performed a series of tricks and stunts that confused and angered the factions, leading the entire populace of the fort to slaughter themselves. The in first light of the morning after, The Red Sun opened the gates of the fortress to an approaching allied force of Elves and Humans, revealing a macabre scene of mayhem within. Not a single Sithanu warrior survived to face the allies. JobsPerhaps the most popular profession among the Sithanu, is that of the close combatant. They train almost from hatching to become the most deadly fighters in the land. Many use their natural poisons to great effect with their tail stinger and claws. Sithanu warriors are not uncommon and often make the bulk of their invading armies. The Sithanu orders of assassins are not as well known as their close combat counterparts but they are just as deadly. They are experts on all manner of gruesome death dealing. Whenever there is a dispute between Sithanu warlords, extra guards are often posted to ward against potential assassins. This has never prevented an assassination but it makes the warlord feel more secure. The priesthoods of the wargods are filled with a variety of evil paladins, warriors, savages, assassins, and close combatants. Sithanu mages are extremely rare and are often short lived. They tend to make enemies quickly and their families often kill them given the chance as magic is regarded as a filthy lowlife occupation. Some few who do escape from their families and manage to become healers and mages often settle in large human cities and towns like Ishtael. Some few have set up a town of goodly aligned Sithanu southwest of Ishtael, down-river. Sisstantine is working nicely and while the people have had to defend against Sithanu warbands, the town has survived and prospered, to become a haven for those mages and healers who wish to escape from the violent Sithanu culture. Sithanu crafters do exist but are so low on the food chain that few become so by choice. Usually only the crippled or diseased who somehow survive being purged gather enough skills to be useful. Sithanu crafters eke out a living making crafts for the warriors and other fighters while avoiding being killed. Some few have escaped to Sisstantine but most are virtual slaves of the warbands.",

Born with disease resistance and poison resistance, the Sithanu have managed to    survive well in the deserts even through the time of the plagues after the Great War.    The Sithanu are the guardians of the greatest treasure of the desert.  Magical crystals are known to appear in the sands.

On the third day after a Granvalian dies, the family gathers on a hilltop and says prayers over the shrouded corpse of their beloved relative, kneeling peacefully under the sky as they chant and sing. They then gently remove the shroud, leaving the corpse naked and vulnerable to the elements. Backing away, they leave a large circle around the corpse and wait. It doesn't take long for the scavengers to come, for they have been part of this ritual for centuries.    The Granvalians watch as the great birds descend upon the corpse and consume it. To many, this would seem a disgraceful way to treat the honored dead. However, for the Granvalians, it is only natural that it be the Spirit Messengers of the Gods who would take the soul of the departed to the heavens. The consumption of the flesh is only a physical representation of the transformation from mortal to spirit, of the changing of energy from material to light.    Once the flesh is stripped from bones and the scavengers have carried away their beloved's spirit, the Granvalians gather the bones and crush them into a powder, leaving no trace of the physical self on this world.

Moorlank warriors patrol their villages and hunt trespassers but Moorlanks do not often kill or confine lawbreakers, instead they test them with ordeals and trials and give them complex tasks to do as a way of atonement. Moorlanks have no real concept of massive warfare as they have as far as their elders can recite always been a peaceful race.

However this appears to be nothing but rank speculation with no evidence to support it and those who disagree feel it is irresponsible nonsense. The Moorlank legends handed down through their elders speak of how they descended a great stairwell into the lands of Thegon. This stairwell was created so that they might journey from a place that no longer exists. They speak of walking through stars gone nova and talking with celestial beings known as Star Guides. Near the main village in Thegon is a mysterious structure about twenty-seven feet tall and seven and a half feet wide at its base, that resembles an obelisk but it has no writing upon it and is of the darkest hardest material in the five realms. No piece of this structure can be removed or broken from it as it is indestructible and immune to all forms of magical manipulation. This structure is referred to as the Stairwell.

At first glance they appear to be nothing more than trees, don't let this fool you, in reality the Trenians are a race of eons-old tree spirits full of life. They move slowly through the forest, speed not being one of their strong points. Trenians, normally a peaceful race, break their somber silence once you strike one of their brethren; they are geniuses on how to exact revenge, and can do so with such a speed that it boggles the mind. Once it was said that a logger chopped down an old Oak for firewood, upon returning to his home he found nothing except a smoldering pile of rubble and the bark of an Oak. HistoryTrenians used to be found throughout all of Saloa, back in the days when it was inhabited by more animals than humanoids. Since the great influx of conscious beings they have moved to the realm of Thegon; finding Thegon to be filled with more animalistic life than the Western Lands. They were also on the verge of extinction, their race being hacked to pieces and used for weaponry, housing, and other such practical causes. This persecution was a direct cause of their becoming isolationists, they shun outsiders who come to their village and usually don't speak much outside of their race. It has been noted that the Trenians not found in The Ring of Trinity are more harmless and will gladly help a lost traveler. AppearanceTrenians look much like trees, which have become a major problem for them. Hopeless romantics have carved things into them to announce their eternal love, and lumberjacks have chopped them down to make a profit. The Trenians have an incredibly low tolerance for disrespect, meaning if you were to anger one enough for it to spread its sap on you, you're now an enemy to all Trenians. The main characteristics which separate Trenians from normal trees can be summed up with one statement. Any tree which does not conduct itself like a tree; either by talking, moving, or attacking you, should be treated as another being and not just a resource.",
        "gen": "Trenian belong to one of two tribes:     The Spryfel tribe do not trust  freely or blindly, but they are, at heart, gentle. The Spryfel dwell in villages hidden deep in the heart of old growth forests where they use the dense underbrush to mask their existence. Mostly, they merely watch intruders who enter their domain, but do not approach them. Instead, using old magic, they bend the forest into a maze, coaxing the very plants themselves into providing a path for the unwary traveler to follow….away from their home.     The Vyrexfel tribe is consumed by their hatred of both men and the Spryfel and do not deign to hide their faces from men. Oh, no. They only use the trees and bushes of their home as a means of ambush, letting the greenery shield them from sight only long enough for them to gain the upper hand. The next thing unwary travelers see is the bone tip of a spear plummeting towards their hearts.",
        "appr": "Stories abound from travelers who speak of the forest itself seeming to come alive and move, of bushes that seem to shimmer and sway on windless days. More often than not, these travelers have encountered the Trenian, a small humanoid that greatly resembles the forests in which they live. Diminutive by human standards, they stand but a mere four feet tall, on average, with only a slight difference between the male and female of the species. Their skin ranges in color from nut brown to a deeper shade, more the color of rich loam.    What makes them stand out the most, though, are the numerous horns which twist and branch from their heads, resembling the limbs of bushes as they reach up towards the sunlight. Like deer in felt, these horns are covered in a thin layer of skin, making them the same shade of brown as the rest of their bodies.    Usually, the Trenian dress their slender forms in simple clothes created from fibers gathered from local plant life and woven into sturdy cloth. They tend to dye their clothes in rich shades of the earth, choosing colors to match each season. Thus, these small, woodland folk can easily blend into their environment and avoid those who would do them harm. What adornments they use are usually provided to them by Nature herself. Leaves are attached to their horns, providing them with camouflage and beauty. Freshwater shells are often woven into necklaces and bracelets, and jewels pulled from the ground grace the foreheads of females, on occasion.",
        "hist": "Long before the struggles that have arisen between the Men of Myzan, the Trenian lived in harmony with the creatures that dwell here. Their lives were intertwined with all the life around them, acting as stewards of the land. However, that came to a halt when a set of men discovered them. At first, the Trenian greeted the men with open arms, innocently inviting them into their villages and offering them shelter. However, these men were not kind souls. These were a band of slavemasters who saw the Trenian as little more than a commodity. Caught off-guard, the forest folk were easy pickings for the warriors who swept through the villages like wildfire, capturing the young and the females, while slaughtering most of the males. Trenian slaves became valued for their ability to coax even the most fallow land into bloom. It was nothing to see a whole troop of Trenians, their fragile shoulders sloped in defeat, kneeling on the ground as they spoke soft words unto the earth, bringing greenery forth at the behest of their masters.    However, this did not last forever, for not all of the Trenians had been captured or killed during those first years after they were discovered by men. Small bands were left behind and, seeing their brethren bend beneath the yoke of slavery, their hearts grew savage. These Trenian cast aside their peaceful ways and learned the art of killing in cold blood, of drawing a bone blade gleefully across a sleeping slavemaster's throat. These rebels raided the men's homes, killing indiscriminately as they freed their loved ones.     While overjoyed to be free, some of those who were rescued found themselves just as afraid of their rescuers as they had been of their masters. These bloodied Trenian were not the same, gentle souls they once knew and, thus, many fled even those who had risked their lives to save them. Feeling betrayed, the rebels threw down their weapons in disgust and moved far away. Thus, the two tribes were born."

    "magnalian": {
        "name": "Magnalian",
        "desc": "MagnaliansFormed of rock and fire, Magnalians are living embodiments of the planet. They live and breath and flow as the earth's blood does. Their thoughts are of the earth as well. They exist primarily as caregivers of the earth but many have become completely independent entities. Agents of the wishes of the natural order but with freewill as to how to accomplish their goals. They primarily exist in Thegon though a few have ventured into the western lands and a certain few have joined guilds and participate in the western land politics.AppearanceSkin hardened by the cooling air their bodies are shells containing burning magmite. They resemble nothing more than statues aflame and lit internally. Where their skin is thinner, magma can be seen. Their touch is surprisingly cool unless they intend for it to burn. They are often adorned with little fans of flame that imitate human hair styles though this is purely for affect. They are normally bald. Their eyes either glow with inner flames or are dark black like obsidian. In fact a sleeping Magnalian resembles nothing more than a large statue made of obsidian.It is quite difficult at times to differentiate between genders as this is mostly for appearances sake and they have copied the humans and other races they have encountered. Often they lack detail (like fingers, and toes) in their anatomy but can shape their skin at will so that it approximates the form they desire. The downside to this flexibility of their skin is they have a difficult time grasping and manipulating objects. And they tend to move extremely awkwardly. Their voices are one and all monotonous rasps like boulders scraping together at a loud volume. It can be quite a chore deciphering a Magnalian's common tongue words.HistoryFor many millennia the life essence of Saloa has been quiescent, and to all appearances, non-sentient. Recently during the last mage wars in Thegon it became known that indeed Saloa is alive. And Aware. She (for convenience sake) took the form of the first Magnalian, interceding in a battle between mages in Thegon. It so happened that the magery used was upsetting Saloa. So she made her presence known. Unlike most races, the Magnalians do not have a long existing culture of their own but they have copied cultures that their \"Mother\" has in her vast memories. Most of the races have adjusted to the Magnalian's existence as if they were just another normal race appearing out of nowhere. Most also fear to anger them. Who wants to battle living earth and fire? Especially when they can call down magics ancient and terrible that burn and disintegrate?The Magnalians have developed a town in the fashion of those they have seen and have joined the Unity alliance with the apparent intention of fitting in. They sit on the Unity council and vote on matters that concern them (such as ecological conservation and geological studies), and pretty much act the way they have seen humans and other races act. Their conduit to the Earth Mother is not constant and her intentions are not always scrutable. The farther away from their home in Thegon they get the harder it is for them to communicate with her. They don't have thoughts the way other races do. That isn't to say they don't think. Its just that their thoughts are processed differently so learning is not easy for them in some subjects while they are amazingly facile in others. Which ones they excel at depends greatly on the individual and their perceived function.It is interesting to note that the Dwarven community has taken their existence as a sign that their Gods are taking an active interest in the goings on in the world. They predict a reckoning soon involving these rock-kindred. As such many dwarves have attempted to forge friendships with the few Magnalians they have met. None have reported success yet.JobsThough not the most intellectually gifted race, Magnalians have a good understanding of natural Magic and thus are exceptional candidates for studying the Art. Many of them with their affinity with fire and earth specialize in one of those disciplines within the Art.Few Magnalians fight. This doesn't mean they can't. In fact they make devastating warriors due to their great strength, natural resistances, and high defenses. They often wield large metallic shields that they use to crush opponents with. Magnalian Paladins haven't been seen yet but the Earth Mother's race is relatively new and inexperienced in religious matters still.Magnalians learned forging from the Dwarves and while not as proficient or inventive they make good quality wares that sell competitively. In addition they seem to have an innate sense of machinery and how it works. And being curious as ever about past civilizations on their mother planet they make inquisitive and careful archeologists.",

Gyrian language is like themselves, humorous and full of hidden meanings depending on the key used to convey the message. They are a recently developed race of beings and have settled in Thegon, setting up nests in unclaimed territory. They are kind hearted mostly unless they are frustrated. When they go to war they can be cruel and capricious towards those thwarting their goals. That is how the term \"foe\" is translated in Gyrian. Where Lemurians represent order and law, Gyrians tend to be more interested in personal freedom and are almost entirely impulsive. This has led them to be creative in the arts but underdeveloped technologically.

Gyrians are light weight and tend to be about 5 and a half feet tall. They are graceful and swift moving in the air though a bit clumsier on the ground.HistoryNot long ago, Lemurian archeologists unearthed a forgotten DragonKing Fortress. Within they discovered libraries full of books on the science of breeding. In addition one unfortunate soul discovered their breeding pit. Within, lined up in large cylindrical tubes there were monstrous remnants of species thousands of years extinct. The sight of such horrors made the poor Lemurian go mad with disgust. He set about smashing the containers and all the other vials and bottles he could find. Unbeknownst to him some serum of an old breeding disease was released into his system through a cut in his skin when he was busy going berserk. Several of his companions were also infected. Days later the Lemurians started noticing changes to their bodies. And the way they behaved began to alarm the other Lemurians. They began speaking in riddles and jokes and became concerned more with personal grooming and their individual well-being than with the group.Soon the hawk-like Lemurians wandered off together. They were quickly evolving thanks to the tailored disease into a new species. They chose to be known as Gyrians after the Gyre Falcons they learned to breed. Within 50 years there were large numbers of them and today they have settled in Thegon and begun to mark their place in history by setting up a Gyrian community where the flock can abide when back from their journeys. Occasionally a Gyrian is born who is more interested in the order of things and they are quickly packed off to live with Lemurians relatives who still remember their old companions, sadly but from a distance. As Lemurians live from three to four times longer than Gyrians this is not as odd as it seems.The Gyrians were quickly befriended by the Moorlanks when they arrived in Thegon and the Moorlanks have taught them the art of using Magic potions as a combat weapon. So unlike in many ways, the Gyrians and Moorlanks have fast become close allies. The Gyrians often scout for their land-bound neighbors to ensure invaders are well known about before they arrive. This has led to some major victories for the Moorlanks and Gyrians and earned them the grudging respect of would be conquerors.",

Spying the beautiful construct, Vadarmi was filled with greed and desire. Joining in the fight, the sorceror began tossing spells towards the brothers. Unfortunately, the two dwarves were also throwing things and it is assumed that one spell bounced off an ingot and got directed at the dragon which then came to life    and ate all three combatants.

Unlike those recently corrupted elves who sucumbed to the lure of pixie soul trapping, The Drow have had millenia to stew in their malignance. They are haters of all that live on the surface realms, and particular those of the Fae races. They are masters of dark magics and evil rituals. They tend to have a matriarchal society but males are often more aggressive and belligerent. The Drow worship ancient evil gods of Death, Destruction, War and Disease.AppearanceWhite flowing hair adorns their heads but they have hair no where else. Where most elves are fair skinned or tanned brown, The Drow are dark as night, with skin tones ranging from indigo to very dark brown. Their eyes are almost always a light silvery white and like all Fae races they have only irises and pupils showing. They have tall willowy bodies and tend to look androgynous. They wear clothing that reflects light, to make them more able to hide in the shadows.HistoryLong ago after life appeared on Saloa, the Fae emerged from the mists and became one of the first races to spread their culture across the lands influencing the other races. Then the DragonKings came conquering and assimilating the other races into their huge empire. The Elves of the Fae were particularly succeptible to the charms of DragonKing society with their love of discovery and art. For a time being the Elves prospered and grew strong in their magics under the leadership of the DragonKing overlords.Then the Orcinians revolted. They built Temples to dark evil gods and slaughtered all they could who would not worship those gods. The Orcinian Templars were prosletyzers and wandered the realms preaching their new revelations and soon their corruption and religious fanaticism spread. Those Elves who were bored and angry with thier masters found reasons to join the Oricinian crusade and soon a faction developed. As the Sithanu were formed of the Ophidians, so were the Drow formed of the Elves. The very word \"Drow\" is shortenedd from an Elven word meaning \"Outcast, bloodspiller, betrayer.\" This term came about as The Drow turned on their brothers and sisters and committed atrocities in the name of liberation. The shocked Elves didn't retaliate immediately and for a time the Drow were more feared in the realms of Saloa than their Oricinian teachers. When the Elves did respond to the Drow depredations the whole world shook with their wars. The DragonKings, dying out and more concerned with esoteric matters didn't intervene. For many years the wars raged and the Elves and Drow once numerous began to dwindle to small pockets of population. The Elves turned to those whom they'd long warred with for help, The Dwarves. The Drow began enlisting monsters and other races to fight for them and gathered immense armies to storm the Elven citidels and wipe out their hated brothers. Fortunately for the Elves, The Drow's strategy of harnessing Demons backfired after the Drow invaded the dwarven citidel now known as HellHole. Many of their monstrous minions revolted and the Drow were forced to flee advancing allied armies. They fled across several realms and then down into the underground where they've lived cloaked in secrecy ever since.Most Elven people when mentioning the Drow do so as an example of what happens to the unwise who think to break with traditions for the sake of personal gain. They don't realize that their ancient evil counterparts lurk below awaiting the day to take their vengeance. They use most of the mystical energy they have gathered to hide their presence from the Undead and other races whose demenses they have invaded. The Mistress of Secrets, currently rule their society with a firm and cruel grip. They use their subjects passions to herd them into which ever actions need doing. Whispers of rebellion echo in the drow halls of rulership, however. Not all the families wish to bend knee to the iron-fisted whip weilding viscious leaders of the Mistresses.

No one knows why the drow settled into the    underground world. Rumor has it that many of the spell casters began to experiment with necromacy and that spells gone awry changed the drow in such ways that the sun caused them pain and death so they fled underground in order to survive.    It is said that long ago a drow shunned the underground world and turned to the good     side.  His name was struck from the drow history.  Although books have been written about him in the human world, all drows deny that he ever existed and that he was a farce created by the humans to weaken the drow structure.

If you are in a caravan travelling through the mountains and an avalanche starts mysteriously, odds are it is SlammerKin having fun while drinking their homebrewed distilled alcoholic products. They love to play but are malicious in their playing and so are not to be toyed with. A drunken SlammerKin gang would think little of playing toss the villagers as afternoon sport between quaffs of thier rotgut swill.AppearanceSlammerKin grow to be over fifteen feet high with some few reaching twenty feet.

It has been said that their ancestral homes in the mountains were cut off for a time from the rest of the world by huge rock slides and it has taken them years to clear a path.Wild and uncouth, the SlammerKin have long resisted being assimilated into the civilizations that have sprung up around them. They steal and use the products made by those civilizations but never become apart of them. Instead they have ruled their little stretches of ridge and gully and fought everyone off who would encroach on their territory. It is rumoured that a cagey Pixie Ranger with more charm than sense taught the SlammerKin to drink then taught them how to brew their own alcohol. Over the years they have refined their brew into something only they can possibly stomach. It is said the ranger did this to make them less likely to raid the villages surrounding the mountains they inhabited.

        "desc": "GhoulsOf all the undead races, Ghouls may be the scariest. Not because of their ferocity in battle, grim demeanors, or pale rotting corpse like bodies but because they are flesh eaters. To be specific they eat the flesh of the living and the deceased. This behavior has given them a well deserved reputation. They tend to group together in \"cliques\" for safety and while some live on the surface hiding in graveyards and cemeteries most find more comforting the lands of the Underground Realm. There they can store their food in mausoleums and not worry about the living attacking them in angry mobs with pitchforks and flaming torches. They have no unifying culture except their necrophagia. Their cliques tend to be small with between ten and forty members with extra members splitting off into new groups. Ghouls don't breed the way normal races do but they can create others of their kind in much the same way vampires do but with less ceremony. Their bite contains the disease that turns individuals into ghouls and its transmission while not 100% a guarantee of success more often than not creates new ones.AppearanceThe stench of death and decay are so much a part of a ghoul's presence its almost impossible to not know when one is nearby unless they take extraordinary measures to hide the smells. Their looks aren't much better. They are seemingly perpetually in a state of decay between being dead and alive. This of course is the final stage of the magical disease that kills them and makes them undead. Their skin is often oozing and pus-filled and their limbs while well connected often have pieces of flesh missing. Their long sharp nails are claw-like and hardened and can cause a mild paralysis and or poison in those injured by them. They wear just enough clothing to mock modesty and the society they originate from. HistoryArinDiechlan Rassach was a formidable foe in his day. Few duelists dare stand against him and all feared him. He was a known necromancer and yet his skill with weapons was hardly matched by any who lived in his time. The atrocities he committed were many but the creation of the magical disease of Ghoulism was perhaps his worst. He is literally the father of the ghoul race. He had a hand in the creation of a few undead species but none so vile or wretched as the ghoul. His plan was to cause a particular family of merchants, The Indiallo to become his undead slaves when one them spurned his advances to their daughter and refused to dual with him to satisfy his honor. He spent weeks in his lab cooking up a variety potions and malignancies.His cohort and friend Amal Alichna, was his downfall. Amal was the person he trusted to pick the right fungi, and dig up the right bodies, and gather the correct minerals and other essentials to alchemy and necromancy. Unfortunately for him, Amal was afflicted with greed and lust and was turned by the rich merchants against his mentor friend with offers of riches and perhaps even a chance at an unmarried daughter. Amal replaced a number of ingredients for the spell ArinDiechlan demanded with similar but inferior materials. When Arin had worked out the final incantations and had arranged for the merchant's dinner wine to be contaminated with special herbs he cast the spell. Nothing happened to the family. For weeks Arin waited all the while fuming. He stopped enjoying eating food and began hungering for flesh, decaying and putrid. As months wore on his distress was soon completed by his appearance degrading to that of a ghoul.One night, out of morbid curiosity, Amal called on his old betrayed friend. He was appalled. His wiser smarter master was gone. In his place was a maddened ravening beast. Out of guilt he began to fetch bodies for his former friend and for a while more things progressed with no outsiders realizing what was transpiring. However, one early evening a curious child followed Amal into a graveyard and watched as he dug up an old neighbor's corpse. Later that night a mob of angry villagers appeared with torches outside the home of Master Rassach demanding answers. Desecration of the dead has long been a serious crime for religious reasons. Receiving no answer they broke down the doors of the house and came upon Rassach eating a dead arm. Some of the peasants were revolted and fled but others still set fire to the place and attempted to barricade any escape from the place.Sadly for the whole world, ArinDiechlan Rassach was a cagey planner and had built multiple tunnels leading away from his house under the earth. He escaped taking Amal with him. When Amal refused he bit him and then dragged his unconscious friend along. The legend of the Rassach ghoul has since then become so wide spread every village has its own variation featuring its own ghouls. Some of those tales are true. Over the years those ghouls who survived have made their homes in the underground and now most seem in servitude to the Elder Vampires who reign there.",
        "gen": "Part of the Reaper's aerial arsenal, ghouls are vampiric bat-like creatures that can often be seen flying over the darkened peaks of Barren Downs.

Extending from their arms from the wrist to the shoulder blades are bat-like wings, thin and light, that grant the ghoul its flight.  Their faces are very similar to those of bats: up-turned noses, tight mouths full of sharp teeth, and large, pointed ears somewhat high and aback on the head.  Their eyes are like glowing beads, however it is unknown how well ghouls can see; their hearing is exceptional.",
        "hist": "Many people believe that vampires can transform into bats and sneak into and out of bedrooms at night, victimizing whomever they find was foolish enough to leave the window unbarred.  This perception is totally false, for vampires have no such ability to physically change their appearance.  They are able, however, to manipulate the perceptions of a victim through mental suggestion.    The “vampire bat” myth came about through a misunderstanding of the ghoul in human culture.  Ghouls were a rare sight until the rise of the First Horde, when ghouls - lesser relatives of the race of vampires - were used as advance raiders.  They were ordered by their commanders, who often were vampires themselves, to descend upon towns and villages for the sole purpose to kill, and to do so quickly and quietly.  The ghouls then developed the practice of feeding on people while they slept in their own beds.  When the town awoke from its nightly slumber, it would find entire families gone, bedrooms and chambers flooded with blood, with little or no evidence as to who or what the murderer was.      Needless to say, the Reapers found this fear and confusion vastly entertaining."

Perhaps it is a few steps ahead of the slime mold, another animal-plant marvel. But, then…what evolutionary steps lie in between the two?    Another sect of naturalists believe that the carnivorous plant is the product of magical tampering by bored mages or, even, the occasional mad druid who has attempted to breed a new form of plant guardian for his grove."

And, like the predators that hunt the stragglers of herd animals, it is the weak ones that daemons prey upon, for they can smell the opportunity for corruption as surely as flies smell rotting flesh.    Waiting for the weak one to stray away from the herd, daemons of bloodlust creep in on the shadows and lay in the tall grass next to it. They whisper dark words laced with hellish magic into the unicorn's ear, searching for the discontent that dwells within its heart. Once that disharmonious chord is found, the daemons strike it again and again, fanning it into a flame of hatred that matches the pureness of its brother's hearts beat for beat.    Some of the weak unicorns manage to resist the temptation. These shake of the daemons and become some of the strongest of their herds. Others are too weak and die at hands of the daemon's magic. Others, though, gleefully give in and embrace evil. These shed their pure white coats, the hair falling from them in a silver mist, to be replaced by glistening blackness.

        "appr": "Feralkins are mostly feline in face features with fangs protruding from their lips. Most of them exhibits physical attributes of what Scholars in Myzan believed as an Ancient Spirit Beast. Varying in size, Feralkins range from two feet to seven feet. They have muscular and well-honed bodies that are mostly covered by hair. They are usually upright in standing and walking but when they run, they use all four of their limbs. The feet and hands have retractable claws that they both use for attacking or defending. They can pass for a human if they wear a heavy hooded cloak.",
        "hist": "Nobody knows where the first Feralkin originated. Many Scholars believed that a wild Spirit Beast fell in love with an elf maiden. The Beast took a physical body but its appearance was so monstrous that the elves attacked when it approached their glen. The Beast fled, full of rage and hate upon the elves. In its flight, it came upon a group a humans. The unlucky and helpless group received the brunt of the Beast`s wildness and anger as it unleashed itself upon them. Only the arrival of the elves who came to hunt the beast down saved them from certain death. After several days, those whom the Beast has touched, found themselves beginning to transform. They then realized that they may have escaped death but not from being tainted by the Beast`s poison. The poison that is transforming, not only their appearance but also their spirit and soul.They were then both feared and pitied. In order to avoid chaos, they left and tried to lead a normal life away from their original home. There were those who fell into kinship with them and sought to be tainted willingly. They started to spread different stories of where they came from. They were accepted with apprehension in most places in Myzan. But there are also other places, where they were hunted, persecuted or outcasted. This resulted to the awakening of the Spirit Beast`s rage and hate within them, driving them to seek revenge by forcibly tainting other humanoid races."

These Nightstalkers are dreaded by travelers forced to spend their night away from the protection of a village or town inn.  Nightstalkers are a race of lesser vampires, the product of an incomplete or failed transformation from living to vampire.  The bite of a nightstalker carries the same curse as that of their higher brethren; therefore, any unfortunate victim of a nightstalker attack is subject to possibly becoming a nightstalker himself, or even a vampire.",
        "appr": "Nightstalkers are surprisingly fair creatures.  They are often human in appearance, though pale skinned and possibly a little sunken in the face.  They get their general good looks from their true forms as vampires, which are very fair, even beautiful, to look upon.  They too have elongated and sharpened fangs like their brethren, as well as razor-sharp clawed fingertips.  These features, unlike those of the vampire, can not be masked from prey, for nightstalkers lack the psychic abilities of vampires.    A newly turned or turning nightstalker may appear as a tattered, mangled, and decomposing corpse - the results of the vicious attack that caused the curse.",
        "hist": "When the nightstalker plague invested Myzan is anyone's guess.  Vampires don't even recall the first of their lesser kin; indeed, many vampires look down on nightstalkers, claiming them not to be of full vampiric blood, giving halflings more respect.  However, no vampire can deny that the nightstalkers are vital to the continued survival of the Undead.  A person bitten by a nightstalker is turned into a necryte soon after death if the curse was passed on.  This stage of living decay is a springboard for further evolution; many go on to become nightstalkers, others become vampires, and still others become more abominable creatures.  Also, because of the nightstalkers' inherent urge to roam the night for blood, the Reaper horde has long  employed them as scouts and watchmen."

Unlike many undead creatures, necrytes are not soulless, wandering corpses, but are rather bodies fighting an inevitable fall to some necromantic curse in an effort to preserve the existence of the soul it hosts.  It is for this reason that there are several Undead races that may stem of the necryte that aren't actually undead at all, such as the feral races, demons, and apparitions.",
        "appr": "Necrytes are horrid creatures that were at one time some other race.  After being afflicted with some sort of necromantic spell or curse, its living body begins to rapidly decline and decay; the effects can be likened to advanced stages of leprosy, but affecting the entire body.  Often the curse is applied through some sort of attack, usually by a Nightstalker or Feralkin.  Due to the intense violence of such an attack, the body or, more appropriately, corpse would be mangled, twisted, ravaged, or otherwise beaten, battered, and bitten even at times beyond recognition.  Though some necrytes chose to remain in this condition, many prefer to allow the curse to run its course and soon adapt the final form associated with the bind placed on them.  Often, this stage in an Undead's development is rather short lived and unmemorable; however, it is in this stage that the taste for blood and flesh is usually acquired.",
        "hist": "From the very beginnings of the Reaper horde, necrytes have played an important part in the rise and terror of the dark alliance.  The fallen Followers who discovered the powers of necromancy turned themselves into necrytes in order to escape death and live indefinitely with great strength and power at their disposal.  However, these first necrytes were unstable, and eventually they wasted away.      Those that came soon after further perfected the dark arts and raised an army of undead creatures to serve them.  At the core of this army was the goal to expand and multiply, and so the passage of evil curses and spells was granted to it.  New recruits were made out of the very people who had once scorned and degraded the Followers, now known as Reapers.  Before being defeated in the Great War of the First, the Reapers could count on turning at least three necrytes for every one fallen undead."

If you are in a caravan travelling through the mountains and an avalanche starts mysteriously, odds are it is SlammerKin having fun while drinking their homebrewed distilled alcoholic products. They love to play but are malicious in their playing and so are not to be toyed with.

It has been said that their ancestral homes in the mountains were cut off for a time from the rest of the world by huge rock slides and it has taken them years to clear a path.Wild and uncouth, the SlammerKin have long resisted being assimilated into the civilizations that have sprung up around them. They steal and use the products made by those civilizations but never become apart of them. Instead they have ruled their little stretches of ridge and gully and fought everyone off who would encroach on their territory. It is rumoured that a cagey Pixie Ranger with more charm than sense taught the SlammerKin to drink then taught them how to brew their own alcohol. Over the years they have refined their brew into something only they can possibly stomach. It is said the ranger did this to make them less likely to raid the villages surrounding the mountains they inhabited.

Once an important military lookout and trading station, it fell into obscurity and was abandoned by the Royal Army.  The elements and time took their toll on the old wood and stone tower, nearly bringing it down and leaving it near ruin.  The few that have since traveled by this tower have reported cries and piercing screams coming from the tower; the sounds could be heard for miles carried on the snow-laced wind.  There have been some brave enough to investigate the location, few have returned.    The survivors have all claimed the same thing.  The tower is now the keep of a fury bent on holding Three Glaciers as a claim of the Reapers.  Anyone who comes too near or threatens the Reaper Tower must be ready to face the rampage of the fury, closely watching from the shadows."

Could it be, then, that the origins of the demon spirits known as wraiths stem from the very beginnings of the Horde?  It is one theory that many of the earliest Followers, humble people misunderstood for their devotion to the ancient gods of Old Myzan, allowed their frustration and discouragement to burn deeply inside, to the point that they were consumed by that black fire.  While some of these lost souls took to necromancy and black magic to vent their aggression, many more succumbed to the darkness in their own hearts, and from those dark Followers would come wraiths.    Whether or not this explanation is true has yet to be decided.  However, it is most certain that the army of wraiths associated with the Horde is indeed a major threat to the land of Myzan."

From these early spells came the first tomes and scripts of necromancy.    The goal of the vampires at the time was to artificially create other undead creatures to do their bidding.  The Bloodmasters of the time were trying to amass an army to combat the growing number of paladins and hunters threatening to wage war on the vampire race.  After many years of war with the feral creatures of the woodlands, the vampire nation was recovering much slower than expected.

The long lived Elves are masters of song, woodcraft and archery and few others become as adept with magic weaving as their Elders. They love their cousins the pixies and often can be seen in the company of halflings and centaurs. Dwarves on the other hand they revile as much as Orcs and Trolls. They tend to appear to be secretive, unfeeling and enigmatic and are seldom seen in large groups. It is the Elven cities that poets often write about when they wax prosaically about beauty and design. Elven cities are almost entirely crafted from woods they cultivate and are often indistinguishable from the forest they are embedded within. Thus leading to the myths about Elven settlements hidden by a veil of mystical power. Many a traveler has gotten hopelessly lost trying to find the cities of the Fae ones. Cold Elven laughter echoing in their ears the entire time has led more than one to go mad in grief and frustration. Appearance Slightly built, and shorter on average than humans, Elves are haughty in appearance with their arched eyebrows and pointed ears. They have (as all Faerie races do) eyes with only irises and pupils showing. Their eye-color ranges from deepest violet to light silver. Their hair tends to be either very dark or platinum. Their skin tone varies from tawny brown to pale snow in hue. Often separate Elven clans will look nothing alike. They trade heavily with other races so the materials of their artifacts and clothing are diverse as are the style and decorations. History Elves are one of the eldest of the races. As such their histories are lengthy and detailed, (almost tediously so). However no one, not an elf, would be able to read them as they are exclusively written in Hindaric, an ancient dialect of Faerie. The races of Faerie were once one race that split off during a great Diaspora fleeing the carnage of the ancient wars. 'DragonKing' is a dirty word in all Elven dialects now as they blame the most ancient and powerful race (they know of) for the ruination of their unity and lifestyles. Once Faerie were a favored people who ruled over the lesser children of Saloa with a benevolent if firm grip. Then the Oricinian corruption drove some to revolt and the hideous bloodshed began in earnest. The Drow another faction of Faerie were the worst offenders and the wars between elf and Drow elf clans became legends. After the Diaspora, the Drow were no where to be found. No one knows where they have gone but prophecies say they will someday return to wreak harm among the Fae. In more modern times Elves have begun withdrawing from interactions with the other races. They now kill intruders in their forests rather than simply lead them astray and are rarely seen in large groups unless its a war-band hunting Orcs, Dwarves or other enemies. Halflings, Gelflings and pixies are still welcome in their demesnes and some Elvish cities have a large population of both but for the most part they've become isolationists and intolerant of outside influences. This doesn't hold true with their trade outposts which are far more cosmopolitan and friendly places to visit."

        "name": "Cookie Monster",
        "desc": "HumansHumans are a relatively new race to Saloa but are quite fertile and have spread across the realms in abundant numbers. They vary greatly in cultures, often aping those of neighboring races, only to turn them around into something different. They are largely traders and because of their expertise with numbers and money they often have been enslaved by other races. Interestingly humans are often the most aggressive races so they are often going to war with other perhaps more peaceful if more powerful races. As a result they have a reputation as being barbaric and warlike even though many other humans are simple farmers and traders.AppearanceAmong the races humans range the most widely in height and weight. They tend to average just under 6 feet tall but can be as small as 4 feet or as tall as 7 feet tall at the tallest. Their hair tends to be red, brown, or blonde with blond and red being the rarest colors. They have eye colors varying from black to brown to blue to gray. They have skin tones from very dark brown ebony to pale white ivory with many tones between. Humans tend to wear drab work clothing but brighter colors for special occasions and holy days.HistoryOne of the youngest races, Humans appeared during the middle of the Cataclysmic Age and began settling the vales of the western lands. They were primitive, with almost no unifying language or customs. Each tribe was different and fought with the others for territory. Completely unaware of the history before their time the humans slowly developed nations through wars and conquest. The other races defeated them time and again, but they simply bred more children and with their inevitable superior numbers scraped out several empires. They connived and manipulated as they grew more sophisticated. Soon instead of using their own soldiers they were hiring mercenaries and brokering backdoor deals and using diplomacy. After the invasion of the Scourge they managed to hammer together a semi permanent alliance called the Unity. Official Saloan time is measured in Before Unity and After Unity and this is a direct result of the accords written by human scribes and lawgivers after the allied armies of Trolls, Orcs, Elves and Humans defeated the Undead Hordes.",
        "gen": "Cookie Monsters are a terrible scourge of the recent years. They have only been sighted during a short period of Myzan's history, and the heroes of the land quickly defeated these menaces. It is said they are divine retribution brought down by the deity known as Decius, destroying those unworthy, and rewarding those brave enough to defeat them.",
        "appr": "They are rather tall and lumberous. Smelling faintly of flour and chocolate. They appear to made from some pure form of chocolate chip cookie dough not before seen in Myzan. They also use a once unheard of magic involving bad hygiene food preparation and overcooking meals.",
        "hist": "No one is sure how or where these creatures come into being. Some say Nioxis had a creative streak of insanity, while others claim they are sent from the heavens by Decius to protect all the innocent baked goods, especially cookies of all kinds. What is known is they only started appearing recently around the festival to celebrate Myzan's birth out of the great Void that is recognized by all allegiances and races. The appearance of these monsters lead some to speculate on the existence of an elemental plane devoted to baked goods."

If they catch a smaller humanoid in their territory the chances are that unfortunate soul will become part of one of their strange tossing games. SlammerKin are usually located on crags and ridges where they can find plenty of ammunition to throw at each other and other interesting targets. If you are in a caravan travelling through the mountains and an avalanche starts mysteriously, odds are it is SlammerKin having fun while drinking their homebrewed distilled alcoholic products. They love to play but are malicious in their playing and so are not to be toyed with. A drunken SlammerKin gang would think little of playing toss the villagers as afternoon sport between quaffs of thier rotgut swill.AppearanceSlammerKin grow to be over fifteen feet high with some few reaching twenty feet. They are typically bald and have rotting teeth. Their eyes are wide and distracted looking, each peering off in a different direction. Most SlammerKin spend their whole adult lives in a drunken stupor from the brews they make. If they weren't theyd be dangerous as well as offensive. Their exceptionally large hands are not suited for delicate tasks but are perfect for throwing things at distant targets. Their breath and body odor is said to be so foul even Dragons avoid them as a food source. Their purple skin is often discolored with splotches of green where infectious diseases have set in because of their generally poor hygene. They never bathe on purpose for fear of drowning or melting. HistoryAs near as anyone can tell these abominations have existed as long as anything else. They have a long history of raiding and pillaging the countryside around them then disappearing for long periods. It has been said that their ancestral homes in the mountains were cut off for a time from the rest of the world by huge rock slides and it has taken them years to clear a path.Wild and uncouth, the SlammerKin have long resisted being assimilated into the civilizations that have sprung up around them. They steal and use the products made by those civilizations but never become apart of them. Instead they have ruled their little stretches of ridge and gully and fought everyone off who would encroach on their territory. It is rumoured that a cagey Pixie Ranger with more charm than sense taught the SlammerKin to drink then taught them how to brew their own alcohol. Over the years they have refined their brew into something only they can possibly stomach. It is said the ranger did this to make them less likely to raid the villages surrounding the mountains they inhabited. However this backfired as SlammerKin now raid for products to make their brew with in addition to shiny trinkets and food.While most slammerkin are unruly bandits with wicked humours there are some who are slightly smarter and more curious than their kin. Those few occasionally leave their rocky homes to investigate the world beyond. They often find the world beyond is not so kind to the large. They often still must resort to banditry to survive."

        "desc": "The DrowAs night is to day, The Drow are to Elves. Unlike those recently corrupted elves who sucumbed to the lure of pixie soul trapping, The Drow have had millenia to stew in their malignance. They are haters of all that live on the surface realms, and particular those of the Fae races. They are masters of dark magics and evil rituals. They tend to have a matriarchal society but males are often more aggressive and belligerent. The Drow worship ancient evil gods of Death, Destruction, War and Disease.AppearanceWhite flowing hair adorns their heads but they have hair no where else. Where most elves are fair skinned or tanned brown, The Drow are dark as night, with skin tones ranging from indigo to very dark brown. Their eyes are almost always a light silvery white and like all Fae races they have only irises and pupils showing. They have tall willowy bodies and tend to look androgynous. They wear clothing that reflects light, to make them more able to hide in the shadows.HistoryLong ago after life appeared on Saloa, the Fae emerged from the mists and became one of the first races to spread their culture across the lands influencing the other races. Then the DragonKings came conquering and assimilating the other races into their huge empire. The Elves of the Fae were particularly succeptible to the charms of DragonKing society with their love of discovery and art. For a time being the Elves prospered and grew strong in their magics under the leadership of the DragonKing overlords.Then the Orcinians revolted. They built Temples to dark evil gods and slaughtered all they could who would not worship those gods. The Orcinian Templars were prosletyzers and wandered the realms preaching their new revelations and soon their corruption and religious fanaticism spread. Those Elves who were bored and angry with thier masters found reasons to join the Oricinian crusade and soon a faction developed. As the Sithanu were formed of the Ophidians, so were the Drow formed of the Elves. The very word \"Drow\" is shortenedd from an Elven word meaning \"Outcast, bloodspiller, betrayer.\" This term came about as The Drow turned on their brothers and sisters and committed atrocities in the name of liberation. The shocked Elves didn't retaliate immediately and for a time the Drow were more feared in the realms of Saloa than their Oricinian teachers. When the Elves did respond to the Drow depredations the whole world shook with their wars. The DragonKings, dying out and more concerned with esoteric matters didn't intervene. For many years the wars raged and the Elves and Drow once numerous began to dwindle to small pockets of population. The Elves turned to those whom they'd long warred with for help, The Dwarves. The Drow began enlisting monsters and other races to fight for them and gathered immense armies to storm the Elven citidels and wipe out their hated brothers. Fortunately for the Elves, The Drow's strategy of harnessing Demons backfired after the Drow invaded the dwarven citidel now known as HellHole. Many of their monstrous minions revolted and the Drow were forced to flee advancing allied armies. They fled across several realms and then down into the underground where they've lived cloaked in secrecy ever since.Most Elven people when mentioning the Drow do so as an example of what happens to the unwise who think to break with traditions for the sake of personal gain. They don't realize that their ancient evil counterparts lurk below awaiting the day to take their vengeance. They use most of the mystical energy they have gathered to hide their presence from the Undead and other races whose demenses they have invaded. The Mistress of Secrets, currently rule their society with a firm and cruel grip. They use their subjects passions to herd them into which ever actions need doing. Whispers of rebellion echo in the drow halls of rulership, however. Not all the families wish to bend knee to the iron-fisted whip weilding viscious leaders of the Mistresses. Soon civil war may break out and the Drow run the risk of being discovered. When that happens there maybe hell to pay for all concerned."
