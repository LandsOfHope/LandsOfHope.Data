        "en": "In appearance, the Darfurk looks very much like a unicorn.  It has the body of a horse and bears a single horn but that is where the simularities end.  A darfurk has a dark hide in various shades of red and black and has eyes that glow like burning embers.  A darfurk approaching in the midnight hours can be a terrifying site as it strikes sparks from it`s hooves from the ground."

        "en": "Historical facts about the Darfurk are rare.  It is impossible for ordinary men to tame much less find one on Myzan making it hard to make a study of these rare creatures. Long ago, one enterprising beastmaster trekked off into the wilderness vowing that he would not return under he had a darfurk for a mount.  He has never been seen since."
