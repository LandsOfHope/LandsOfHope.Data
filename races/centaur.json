        "en": "Centaurs live on the plains of the higher realms of Myzan.  Though they do live in a   herd, they are surprisingly monogamous and hold family most dear.  The foals are   bright eyed and energtic yet extremely shy around strangers and the older colts are   very mischievous with the elders.  The males are known to be great warriors who can   become \"berserkers\" when the herd is threatened.  The female centaurs gather the   food and school the young in the way of the Centaurs."

        "en": "Centaurs are a race of beings that have the form of a human from the waist up and   the body of a horse below.  The males are very muscle bound from all the hard labor  they perform in day to day living and the females are quite often beautiful and mesmerizing to any human male who sees them.  The centaurs come in many colors  but the rare champagne colored ones with blue eyes and bronze colored hair are always initiated as a seer."

        "en": "Centaurs were once known to roam Knotwood Valley southwest of Springlade from the western ranges east to the great sea.  When the humans began building cities and towns the centaurs moved on. A famous seer named Huressia the Bold foretold the growth of the Reapers and the entire race of centaurs decided to follow Huressia into the unknown realms in order to keep their families safe.  Only the bravest and strongest warrior can surmount the vast mountains surrounding the plains they live on."
