        "en": "The common appearance of spirits in Myzan is that of a disembodied skull with a long trail of flowing glowing hair. This is not actually hair but the spirits manifestation within our realm. The skull is either a specially prepared vessel a person who wishes to invoke the spirits has prepared, or another manifestation solidified by the spirits will."
