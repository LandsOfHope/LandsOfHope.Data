        "en": "For centuries, the essence has been sought by alchemists for, well…their essence. By killing an essence, the alchemist can often extract pure magical energy from the being as it dies. This magical energy can then be added to concoctions, giving their wares greater power and longevity. "

        "en": "An essence is a difficult thing to describe, for it has no true form. As an ethereal being of pure magic, it is more often than not completely invisible, undetected by the mortal senses. However, on those occasions when it deems to show itself, the essence appears as a vaporous, glowing, vaguely humanoid shape. Floating above the ground, it has no legs. However, if you look closely, you can almost make out two arms and maybe a long, featureless face within its misty form.    While it has no solid body to speak of, energy seems to caress the essence's shape, running along its form in waves that eventually rise upwards like flames to flicker and dance, even if there is no wind about. Were you to put your arm through the creature, it is uncertain whether you would feel a fire's heat, electricity's sting or nothing more than a cool, wetness as though you passed your hand through fog."

        "en": "Essences have been around for as long as Myzan has existed. They are creatures born of the very heart of the world, created from the remnants of the magic that made formed Myzan, itself.    When great artisans create their works, there is always a little bit of material left over. A stonemason grinds down a raw gem to create a jewel, and gem dust is left behind. A sculptor carves a statue from wood, leaving chips littering the floor at his feet. It was exactly the same when the gods created Myzan. There was a bit of life magic left over from their initial creation, and these bits became essences.    Now, many artists would clean up their work, brushing away leftovers so that their creation is pristine. The gods, however, looked down upon the essences and they smiled. These creatures were not “leftovers” but another form of life to add to the diversity of their creation. The gods sat and watched quietly as the essences stumbled about, at first, wandering aimlessly as they explored the world and stretched their senses. After awhile, the gods moved on to creating other forms of life, leaving the essences to grow into whatever they wished, just as they would leave all the races to their own devises.    And, what did the essences do? They grew in power and desire, seeking out sources of magic to add to their own. Oh, they do not gather magic to use as a wizard does. Instead, they seek magic to add to themselves, to consume like the finest of wines. Essences can often be found around ley lines, soaking up the magic in those mystical places, reveling in feeling the power course through their bodies."
