        "en": "Shambling mounds are sqaut and bulbous with spikes that run down their backs and across their shoulders.  Webbed fingers and toes make them very agile in water. The shambling mound can sit without movement for days at a time then suddenly  burst into quick movement that catches its prey off guard.  A little known fact is that the shambling mound is a plant rather than an animal."

        "en": "Many centuries ago a mad druid began experimenting with magic in ways that the other druids did not condone.  Instead of working to make the world balanced, this druid, who`s name has been lost in antiquity began to create mobile plants that would attack on his order. Many strange species were born through his insane ideas.  The shambling mound is one of the few who still survive today."
