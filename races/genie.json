        "en": "The genies of Myzan are hard to come by.  They spend much of their time in lavish oil lamps of fine metals, waiting for their next master to happen across them and bid them to come forth.  The lucky master then has the mighty power of his genie in his hands to do his bidding, whatever that might be - eternal youth, immeasurable wealth, many fine women - so long as he has not used up all three of his wises or overstepped the bounds of the genie's power."

        "en": "Genies are most often mystical men of magical energy, encased within some medium - usually an oil lamp.  There are also female genies, and many a mortal man has clamored after the possibly of finding a seductive wish-giver.  No genie can be said to be ugly, indeed the majority are as pleasing to look upon in their fine jewelry and cloths as the enticing elf.  They can appear as a vapor rising out of their medium or as a solid humanoid.  The color of their vapor/skin signifies their family lineage, and the tones can be used by others to tell their gender."

    "hist": {
        "en": "The well-known “three wish” rule originated many, many years ago.  An old man found a genie's lamp in the sand just outside his sea side home.  Upon meeting his new magical friend, the old man was excited at the possibilities.  He could live forever and be eternally youthful.  He could have as much money and fame as he could want.  But inside his heart, he only had one wish.  He wanted his only son to be happy.  The son had spent his whole life caring for his father, who was slowly dying from a disease no doctor could cure.  His mother and sisters were all gone; they had sold themselves away to strange men seeking money to help the old man, while the young man, only a small boy at that distant time, was left to work hard and care for his father.  The old man died without asking his genie for anything, not even comfort.  Out of compassion, the genie lent his services to the son.  Immediately, the son demanded that the genie revive his father, whole and without illness.  The genie granted the son's wish and the father was brought to life.  The son then demanded that his sisters and his mother be returned home; the wish was granted.  The son continued demanding wishes from the genie, and by the great Code of the Genie, he complied, until finally, after many wishes that left the son and his family very rich and famous in their land, the genie was ordered by the son to die.  And by the great Code of the Genie, he complied…  No longer will a genie willingly give away infinite wishes.  In fact, a genie will only grant his service for a lifetime to a soul that has truly befriended him.  As for the old man's son, all his fame, money, and even his family disappeared the moment the genie granted his last wish."
