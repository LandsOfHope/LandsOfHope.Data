        "en": "The great deserts of Myzan harbor a deadly secret.  Sandworms of Myzan are beasts of unimaginable power.  These enormous creatures live in the sands of the desert, “swimming” through it as if it were water to a fish.  Their great mouths can swallow a man whole.  An adventurer’s only defense is to scan the horizon for moving ripples in the sands.  This is a tell tale sign of the movement of a sandworm.  There are some who hunt the great worms for sport although, few do so and fewer are successful."

        "en": "Many sandworms reach lengths of 25 - 35 feet and sit 8-10 feet high.  They have sectioned bodies that have armor plates.  They also have no known eyes but sense direction by sensing even the tiniest vibrations in the sand.  A huge circular mouth lined with teeth, sits at the front of a sandworm's tubular body.  Coloration of the worms is often the color of the sand in which the beast lives."

        "en": "Many have tried to kill sandworms and many have failed.  One of the greatest trophy hunters, Bologna the Pompous, once went after his greatest trophy.  He wanted a female worm and her baby.  Little is known about the breeding of sandworms but that didn't stop old Bologna.  As proudly as possible he marched out into the sands with his hunting companion, who was known to be the one who actually killed the trophies.  They never came back and no trace of them was ever found except a small message tied to the leg of a carrier pigeon...    “HELP! Sandworms!”    Obviously, Bologna the Pompous met his match."
