        "en": "Snakes are long, legless animals that have a head with small, beady eyes and a  forked tongue.  Their body sizes range from a few inches to over ten feet in length.  Snakes have been known to slide through grass, slither up trees, crawl over rocks or  curl up in shadowy areas. Snakes lay eggs in nests that are hidden in grass or buried  in sand."

        "en": "Mankind has found many uses for the snakes.  Making items from their skins has  kept many a leatherworker fed during hard times although finding enough hide can  be a dangerous time consuming task.  Some people collect the venom from the  more dangerous snakes for various nefarious reasons.  At times the odd sight of a person bearing a pet snake wrapped around them has caused people to gasp in  surprise.  This sight has been less and less common since the day they found poor  Simeon Tadglemmer slumped in the back streets of Springlade held tight in the  coils of his pet python with Simeon`s left foot deep in the snake`s throat."
