        "en": "Bats live almost all over Myzan but they avoid extreme temperatures thus avoiding the very hot lava areas and the frozen wastes.  They can be found in the forests living in trees or found in underground caverns and mines.  Most bats eat insects but  some bats have been known to be blood drinkers."

        "en": "Bats are small furry mammals that most often come in colors of brown or grey. They look like flying rodents with leathery wings and two hind legs.  Large ears help them fly in the dark while they listen for echoes off of objects around them.  Strong claws on their hind legs allow them to grip cavern ceilings and hang upside down to rest."

        "en": "Bats have been around as long as humans can remember. At first they were believed to be night birds until a closer look was taken.  Many tales have been told of bats attacking humans and large animals leaving bloodless carcasses to be found in the morning.  In fact, it is largely believed that a bat bit the first Reaper and thus the Reapers were formed."
