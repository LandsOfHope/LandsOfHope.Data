        "en": "The Tuatha de danann are a tribe generally unknown by men.  They watch over the earth and its lands and life while remaining far from the prying eyes of those who do not understand the importance of their work.  A warrior tribe of uncommon pixies, the Tuatha travel about the land tending the earth and defending its well-being.  The fruit of their labor is enjoyed by all who themselves care deeply for the splendor and grandeur of nature."

        "en": "The tribe of the Tuatha de danann is one of a group of pixies that spend much of their time out of sight and undetected, going about their business in relative solitude.  They are rather small creatures, very human-like, often growing no larger than five inches tall.  They do not, however, allow their stature to detour their spirit as a Tuatha will not hesitate to defend its charge if at all threatened.  They often arm themselves with spears and armor enchanted with various earth magics of which they are masters.  The Tuatha de danann fly about on a set of paired wings, light and translucent.  Up close, one would notice the Tuatha's resemblance of the elves; they have thin eyebrows over keen eyes, pointed ears, and silky hair oft worn long, over the shoulders, or tied.  Unlike other pixies and fairies, the Tuatha do not emit much light if any from their magic infused bodies, nor do they trail mana enriched dust when they fly.  They are, however, just as skilled at the creation of fine pixie dust and magic rings as their many relatives."

        "en": "When the Angels were sent to create a place for the coming Newborns, the Elements were fashioned.  Flame, water, air, lightning, and earth were among those base elements, and from those building blocks, Myzan was born.  The power of the great Elements flow throughout Myzan even to this day, and such power frequently tempts those who would seek it for their own selfish desires.  To prevent the abuse of the Elements, the Heavens sent among the Newborns creatures like unto men, but sensitive to mana like unto elves.  Fairies and various pixies were soon born of these and guardians they became, of the Elements and of the Newborns themselves.  For ages have tribes like the Tuatha de danann watched over the earth and the powers that bind and sustain it."
