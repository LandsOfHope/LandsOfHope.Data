        "en": "They range from sizes of a small dog to easily the size of an average man. Their skin secretes a slimy goop which is harmless to itself, but acidic to everything else. Observations show the males and females alter their skin colors to distinguish themselves unlike most other slug species."

        "en": "The giant slugs of Juratania are related to the common tiny slugs of Myzan. The difference is the ones in Juratania have been cut off from the rest of Myzan. Living in the harsh environments of the realm, they grew and evolved into nasty creatures that one should be cautious of. First discovered by the Eversight Expedition."
