        "en": "Cute, cuddly little bunnies, rabbits can procreate faster than almost any living creature. They are generally cute, fun little animals that make great pets for little human children. They also make a tasty snack for younger, or even older, dragons, or other large beasts of prey. Wolves eat them as a nice little meal once in a while. Werewolves use them as a source of nutrition when they can get a hold of them. Otherwise, rabbits are fun little woodland creatures."

They are seen hopping through the entire land of Myzan, including the frigid area called Three Glaciers. They hop, and hop, and hop some more. They are cute, cuddly, and most humans cannot see why anyone would want to hurt one, unless it was a matter of survival."

        "en": "Rabbits are an old race, brought to Myzan by humans. They have frequently destroyed gardens, just from being alive and surviving. They enjoy being spoiled with carrots, and probably always will. They can be vicious at times, but only when attacked in groups. Most times, they will run and hide. They have always run instead of fought, whenever possible. They have never gone near humans and battle that go on between the species. They honestly have not cared. They probably don't know enough to."
