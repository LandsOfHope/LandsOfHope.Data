        "en": "Cows or cattle are normally peaceful creatures of the grasslands.  At first glance they seem slow and dumb but if provoked they can annihilate the unwary adventurer.  Cows are often seen traveling in herds of 20 to 50 animals.  The most dangerous are  mother cows when their young are endangered."

        "en": "Long bodied and four legged, these creatures closely resemble the horse.  A wide head sits upon a thick neck and rather pudgy looking body gives them the appearance of innocent, gentle creatures.  Often cows are covered with large splotches of color with a background of white."

        "en": "When humans first saw cows they thought them wise and strong.  Early humans worshiped the cattle for their ability to provide for all of human kind`s needs.  Milk and meat for food, bones for weapons and tools, and hide for clothing were important to all of the inhabitants of Myzan.  All races today use the cows in the same ways.  Cattle were and still are a vital part of the world`s economy."
