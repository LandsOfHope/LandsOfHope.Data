        "en": "Stinging Nettles are terrifying looking plants.  They have heads that appear to have almost human faces born within long pointed spikes that form a ball.  Tiny hairs cover the plant that ooze a chemical combination that will burn skin like acid. The stinging nettle has strong yellow widespread roots. What makes this plant   different is these roots are mobile and the plant can travel far from where it was  first rooted."

        "en": "Stinging nettles at one time were ordinary plants found here and there around Myzan. Although known for their sting, they were also found to be good herbs for different purposes.  Suddenly the roaming plants were everywhere.  At the same time people began to disappear from Myzan.  Rumors were spreading about how the nettles were eating people. Plants that were killed were found to sometimes drop bones. Panic began to spread throughout Myzan.  One day a young couple were walking through the forest when the man spied a  flowering bush he had never seen before.  Winking at his beloved, he walked over  and picked a blossom for his lady.  To her surprise and dismay, her lover suddenly  turned into a stinging nettle before her eyes.  Fleeing for her life, she fled back to  the village and told her heartbreaking story to the villagers.  No one has ever found out where the new flowering bushes came from but today a  gift of flowers is no longer the best choice to get for a loved one"
