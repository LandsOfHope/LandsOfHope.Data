        "en": "Normally they have no appearance on our plane of existence, but when summoned by a skilled warlock using the candle focus, it binds the spirit into the flame, giving it a physical and visible form. No one knows why it chooses shades of blue, perhaps because the language Lifetakers speak can not be spoken by any mortal unless their tongue has been removed and passed through both ears before being reattached."

There has always been belief in demons that can drain your vitality and soul. It is unknown who the first warlock to summon one of these was, but the rites to create the summoning focus, a candle, has been a long held secret by many elder warlocks."
