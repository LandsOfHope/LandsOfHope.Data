        "en": "Tall and stuffed with straw, Scarecrows are often used to guard the gardens of farms.  They are dressed in the worn and tattered clothing of the farm owners.  These rags give the scarecrow a very spooky appearance.  Often they are thought to be watching those who travel near them and many believe that when they are assembled, they can move about."

        "en": "Throughout the many eons that farming has been a widely used skill, scarecrows have been used in gardens throughout Myzan.  Most are inanimate but some have been brought to “life” by clever mages.  These walking and talking scarecrows often becomes the assistant to their farmer or wanderer.  Often, there is a long period of time where the family of the farmer adjusts to having a live scarecrow.      Many years ago a demented farmer/wizard decided that he should rule the lands near his farm.  He began to build an army of scarecrows to capture those lands.  The local Baron scoffed at the old, and slightly demented, wizard.  This Baron's army was surprised by the veracity and madness with which the scarecrows fought.  In time the scarecrow army was defeated but not without exacting heavy casualties on the human army."
