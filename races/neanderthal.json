        "en": "Dim witted yet strong is a good description of a Neanderthal.  These “humanoids” are surprisingly agile and strong though their speech is often confused for the grunts of wild animals.  They have developed the use of rudimentary tools and weapons as well as some “clothing.”  Neanderthals make caves and holes into dwellings “furnishing” them with fur and stones.  The sight of a group of Neanderthal warriors lumbering towards you is a sight that has stricken fear into the hearts of many great heros."

        "en": "Often seen lumbering in a crouched position, the Neanderthal hunches at all times.  It’s hair is messy and dirty and often the color of dirt.  Wearing the skins and bones of animals in the fashion of loincloths gives them a dirty and uncivilized look.  They are often followed by a horrendous stench that is easily recognizable.  Their faces are human like yet longer and unintelligent looking.  The male and female look extremely similar. The only real way to tell the difference is that females often try to make them selves look “prrty” (pretty) by adding trinkets to their hair and clothes.  Most of which happen to be small bones from game killed by the tribe."

    "hist": {
        "en": "The great Neanderthal shaman “Ugo the gaseous” was once interviewed by a brave historian monk.  This monk was able to patch together the unintelligible grunts into a brief history of Neanderthals.  Apparently a long time ago the great “kingdom” of Neanderthals ruled the world.  Suddenly a great plague followed by war tore the kingdom apart and Neanderthals scattered into many tribes.  Some advanced in intelligence and became “umns” (humans) others just stayed as they were and are still around today.  Although a very convincing story, the historian was not convinced and died in his search for the truth, ironically by the club hand of a Neanderthal."
