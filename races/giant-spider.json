        "en": "Giant Spiders are terrible creatures of fear and legend.  Magically enhanced versions of their smaller cousins, giant spiders terrorize the forests and caves of their homelands.  Many wise adventurers avoid a forest or cave filled with huge strands of sticky material.  These webs are strong enough to tangle and capture even orcs, let alone humans.  Many unwary travelers have fallen victim to the highly deadly giant spiders."

        "en": "At over six feet tall, a giant spiderâ€™s eyes are often at or above eye level with humans.  Almost exactly the same as small spiders, they have eight legs and a three sectioned body.  They often have large terrifying stingers that can pierce anything but the best made chain mail.  They carry the scars and marks of many battles proudly and have many huge eyes that gleam of intelligence.  Hairs cover the great beasts and they are often colored in blacks and browns."

        "en": "Giant Spiders were created by magic.  This was no accident but a grand scheme by the reapers.  They wanted pets and guardians for their lands.  Many different types of animals were enhanced to guard the reapers but spiders are by far favored over all others.  Their deadly and sadistic personalities are often enhanced with their bodies.  Spiders are also very intelligent compared to other evil creatures.  Now as the reaper threat is becoming more and more intense some among the reapers are even breeding armies of giant spiders and teaching them what no animal should know!"
