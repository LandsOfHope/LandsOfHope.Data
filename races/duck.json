        "en": "Rarely feared, ducks hold a cute and loveable status in the realms of Myzan.  These feathered creatures are often seen waddling around near lakes and rivers.  Too many adventurers have taken these animals for granted and attacked.  Thinking that they will be an easy meal is quite foolish.  Ducks can be ferocious when cornered."

        "en": "Short statured and wide bodied, ducks have long thin legs with webbed feet.  These feet enable the ducks to swim through water with ease.  A long neck sprouts from the body and ends with a small head, from which protrudes an orange bill.  A duck's body is covered with feathers that vary in color but are most often white and shades of brown."

    "hist": {
        "en": "“Ducks in a row,” is a saying known all over Myzan.  This actually originated from an ancient contest of will, stamina and patience.  At the time it was called “Gro'n” it is now known as “duck herding”.  The object of the contest is to line the ducks between two logs.  Two competitors face off at a time gathering, sorting and lining up the ducks.  The flighty and easily distracted ducks often do not stay lined up for long so the competitors must move quickly to herd his or her ducks.  Great players are able to multitask mentally and physically and know the ducks and their behavior very well."
