        "en": "Lizards usually are tiny creatures but some have been seen  that spanned over ten feet long that hunt larger prey such as dogs. Most lizards have long bodies that resemble the alligator.  They have a tongue that is almost the length of their bodies that they use to catch scents out of the air and to capture food with.  They have a soft skin and many kinds of lizards can change color in order to blend into the background for defense."

It was long believed that dragons were born from the lizard family. When one holds a lizard smaller than the tiniest finger of a child that can be hard to fathom."
