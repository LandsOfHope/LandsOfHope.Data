        "en": "Most Spriggans that are seen are no more than a halfling sized boulder. Though it has been known that Spriggans can \"grow\" as large as a three ton boulder. Generally their color is that of the surronding rock. If you look carefully, you can make out a face."

        "en": "Spriggans, like most of the spirit guides modern shamans summon are older than most recorded history. Though a recent expedition to the mountains of Royal Hollow had seen them in their natural enviroment when one inadvertantly ran over one of the expedition team. Like Bogles, they have been misclassified as Elementals of the plane of earth."
