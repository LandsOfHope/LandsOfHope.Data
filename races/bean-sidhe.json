        "en": "Another relative of pixies and other fey. The bean sidhe are spirits of plants. While they look humenoid, the bean sidhe`s physical body is actually that of a small bean, like a snow pea pod. Through shamanistic coaxing, the spirits of these plants can be released. They have a need to absorb mystical energy while in spirit form to both nurish and sustain themselves outside their bean pod."

        "en": "Most of the bean sidhe, when in their semi-physical form stand roughly five feet in height. The males have a blueish tint and aura, while females are green. Their bodies arnt exactly solid, giving them the ability to reach into another creature and tap directly into its mystical energy, if any, to absorb it."

        "en": "The first bean sidhe is thought to have been summoned by a shaman who talked to his food, untill one day his food talked back. In his bowl of beans he claimed to hear the dieing voice of a spirit asking him to help its people. Taking a fresh bean pod and performing a simple ritual released the dormant spirit inside. Ever since, shamans have been taught to carry a few pods around incase they ever need a friend in a pinch."
