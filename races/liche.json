        "en": "Liches are usually wizards who wished to seek life beyond death. Performing rituals to transform themselves at their deaths into an undying creature to live thousands of years beyond what they should. While most liches are within the ranks of the Reapers, there are a few who stay neutral and only wish to further their own goals and projects."

        "en": "Liches tend to appear as they did in life. As the liche ages its skin pales, or even changes to a bluish pale due to the lack of circulating blood, which has turned to a thick noxious ichor. Before their hair falls out completely it turns a pure white. In life they were wizards, but many liches utilize the undead strength their form hides to attack using hand to hand styles."

        "en": "Among the old ones, the predecessors of the modern day Reapers are the liches. Humans performing sacrifice and rituals to the Old Gods to obtain a body that will not die. It is said that some of the eldest liches in Myzan hold the reigns of its history. Most living scoff at this, but sometimes the truth is far scarier then the stories tell."
