        "en": "The Biting Nettle is a smallish plant that has a short stalk with soft green leaves that are covered with silky hairs.  They bear flowers and the base of the plant has yellowish, spreading roots.  The stem of the plant has the same silky hairs as the leaves.  These hairs are deceptive. Beautiful and silky they may be but they release a toxin when touched that causes great pain and sores."

        "en": "According to history, the Biting Nettle used to be a common harmless herb found in many areas of Myzan.  A young Diviner fell in love with a beautiful woman who had many suiters.  One of these suiters was a well-known warrior and the diviner feared he would lose his love to him.  Hearing that the warrior planned a luncheon in  the shady forest with the lady, the diviner decided to create something that would keep the warrior too busy to go.  He grabbed a handful of nettle, cast a spell on it and told it to attack the warrior.  Unfortunately for him, the nettle wasn`t a very intelligent creature and he had to give it a push to send it on its way.  The young diviner fell to the ground from the pain and developed an instant rash all over his body.  And the nettle?  Once it  reached the forest, it went its own way and became a nuisance for everyone."
