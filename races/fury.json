        "en": "Furies are a race of impish demons of the same order as banshees and gibbers.  They are not especially strong or menacing, nor are they very social creatures.  They tend to be fond of darkness and solitude, often frequenting dense woods or large, abandoned estates under the cover of night.  Most think of furies as shy creatures; the wise are those that realize a fury is by no means shy or harmless, and that its attractive lure is what makes it dangerous."

        "en": "Furies are often confused as shying children or young maids when approached in the darkness.  Their cowering draws the concerned and unsuspecting close were they can see pitiful, helpless eyes flare with devious intent and slender, pointed fingers curl in an enticing invitation.  Once drawn in, the true intent of the seemingly lost child is revealed to the unfortunate good soul, too late for them to resist.    Because they stay close to the shadows, furies are most attractive when seen in the errant light of the moon.  Their long, straight hair seems to shine in the light and hide pointed ears and darkly cute faces with impish grins.  Their slender frames are very elegant and swift when in motion.  Their skin is usually one of many shades of grey, purple, or blue - tones that help them hide in the darkness."

        "en": "There are stories of haunted mansions and abandoned estates from which strange noises and eerie screams rise.  There are also caves and sections of deep wood that are feared as evil territory.  Many of these stories are just that - stories.  However, there are some such legends that have been confirmed as haunting grounds for lone furies and banshees alike.  One such location is an old watchtower deep in the drifts of Three Glaciers.  Once an important military lookout and trading station, it fell into obscurity and was abandoned by the Royal Army.  The elements and time took their toll on the old wood and stone tower, nearly bringing it down and leaving it near ruin.  The few that have since traveled by this tower have reported cries and piercing screams coming from the tower; the sounds could be heard for miles carried on the snow-laced wind.  There have been some brave enough to investigate the location, few have returned.    The survivors have all claimed the same thing.  The tower is now the keep of a fury bent on holding Three Glaciers as a claim of the Reapers.  Anyone who comes too near or threatens the Reaper Tower must be ready to face the rampage of the fury, closely watching from the shadows."
