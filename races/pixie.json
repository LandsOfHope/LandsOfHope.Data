        "en": "Pixies appear from a distance as small globes of light that seem to dance in the air.  It is only when you get closer that it is possible to detect the tiny body within the light.  Delicate features form the tiny faces and soft glowing wings sprout from their  backs allowing them to flutter from place to place."

        "en": "Pixies do not seem to have a real language of their own and appear to be on the edge of being sentient.  Rarely seen in groups, the pixies wander like butterflies or more aptly, the fireflies.    Throughout history it has been said that a \"pinch\" of pixie dust will create magical powers and many a young human has gone off on a pixie hunt, never to be seen again.  Though they are basically shy creatures with a playful attitude, the pixies will protect themselves as many have discovered."
