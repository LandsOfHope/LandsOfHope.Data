        "en": "Many types of demons exist. The Hellwarden is a curiosity of the lower planes. It does not attack, but its defense is unmatched in the lower planes. These demons take it upon themselves to act as jailers to the demonic beings who should never be let out, only because it would bring the wrath of the mortal planes down on the whole of the lower planes. And that is just no good for demon kind."

        "en": "Their robes and shield are simple, but simple looks belay their power. They can remove some of the force from even the strongest blows from all mortal weapons. Their wings appear to be non-functional, but they can glide with them, they are more for intimidation factor. The difference between males and females is almost non existent."

        "en": "They tend to keep out of mortal affairs, preferring to tend to their duties of protecting the lower planes from us, as much as us from the denizens that would ruin the fun. The first one was summoned many centuries ago, and created a pact with a warlock, that should the warlock or its ilk need, the hellwardens will serve, for an ample offering of flesh of course."
