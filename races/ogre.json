        "en": "Ogres have large, deformed bodies that carry a stench that can be detected from far away.  With massive shoulders and long bulging arms the ogre appears unbalanced as it lurches towards a victim which is deceptive since an ogre can be very quick.  Quite often the ogre will have a mixture of human and animal features such as boar`s tusks protruding from it`s mouth."
