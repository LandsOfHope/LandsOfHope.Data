        "en": "Large ferocious felines, the tigers are feared predators.  A tiger is one of the most talented stalkers and can lie in wait, patiently, for prey to approach as well as quietly slink close enough to pounce.  Seeing a tiger in mid air falling towards you is a sight most would rather do without."

        "en": "A tiger has a long, bulky body that can measure over six feet long and with its tail, it can be nine feet from nose to tail tip. Strong legs end with large, clawed paws that are one of the tiger`s most deadly parts.  With a broad head bearing intelligent eyes and deadly fangs, the stare of the tiger can mesmerize its prey. Some breeds even have large, boar-like fangs protruding from its mouth and these can be the deadliest ones of all.  The fur of a tiger is striped in various colors mostly in oranges, yellows and blacks though the rare black and white striped tiger can be found."
