        "en": "Giants are solitary beings who prefer to live far from other creatures of the world.  Most can be found deep in the mountain ranges where they are very territorial and quickly explode into a blood rage if they feel trespassed upon. Although they have a reputation for stupidity and temper they are basically a very shy species and use their anger as a weapon to keep others away. A little known fact about giants is their incredible talent in woodworking."

        "en": "Towering well over the other races of Myzan these creatures truly are giants.  Both males ad females have large bulky bodies with muscles bulging so massively that they almost appear deformed. When in a rage their voices bellow out like thunder but when they are at peace one could almost say they sound like a mountain murmuring."

    "hist": {
        "en": "Very little is known about the history of the giants due to their solitary ways.  Scholars and archeologists have found few clues but the ruins of a city deep in the  western mountain ranges  are believed to have been an early site populated by the giant race though they are long gone from there.  Giants have been known to rise up as a nation when Myzan is threatened as when the Great War between the Society and the Exiles arose. They are known as formidable warriors who can cause major havoc and destruction before they melt away and disappear once the threat is over."
