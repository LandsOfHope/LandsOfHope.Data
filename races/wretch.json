Empty eye orbs seem to stare out with vile intelligence.  A strong stench of decaying  matter usually preceeds the creature`s arrival."

This made them a difficult enemy to vanquish and an important part of the undead army.  Today most Wretch wander alone attacking any living soul it spies. As the coming Reaper army tries to gather strength, most Wretch will answer the call."
