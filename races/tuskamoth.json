        "en": "The Tuskamoth are savage killers who dwell in the realms of Lakeview and Three Glaciers. Their range includes the dirt and grassy areas and also includes the mountains.  Tuskamoths dig in the ground for roots and insects.  Their diet also consists of fruits and vegetables but they have been known for eating eggs and small creatures. Fast runners, the Tuskamoths are hunted for sport and their intelligence makes them a difficult prey."

        "en": "The Tuskamoth are large animals and can stretch up to five feet in length and weigh over 300 pounds.  Covered with stiff hair in shades of browns or blacks and with large curved tusks coming from their snouts, the Tuskamoth is not the most beautiful creature of Myzan.  Beady, red eyes lock onto a victim with wicked intelligence just  before the Tuskamoth attacks."

    "hist": {
        "en": "The tuskamoth was a failed experiment years ago when a farmer decided to create a breed of farm animal that could be intelligent enough to stay near the farm while foraging yet be formidable enough to protect itself without a herder.  He was excited to see his new Tuskamoth grow strong and large enough to provide meat for a long time but when he brought out his axe to slaughter it, the Tuskamoth proved to be more intelligent than he knew.  At the sight of the farmer approaching, the Tuskamoth squealed, gathered his herd and the last the farmer saw of them was a cloud of dust  rapidly disappearing in the distance.  Since then, the Tuskamoth has distrusted humankind and has attacked on sight."
