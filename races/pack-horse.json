        "en": "Gentle and useful animals, Pack Horses are found all over Myzan.  Many different breeds of pack horses exist but the most coveted are very large and strong.  The stronger the horse the more it carries.  This has led these animals to be bred very secretly.  Coveted horses often come not from the wild but from farms.  These animals are extremely expensive.  Seeing as they are so useful, owners often keep them as far from battle as possible.  Some lucky adventurers have found these beasts in the wild."

        "en": "Exactly like a regular horse in every way, the pack horse has four long legs with hooves on the ends.  They are extremely muscular animals with broad shoulders yet they have a long humble face that often looks sad.  The eyes are on the sides of the head which gives them incredible peripheral vision.  Their fur lays flat against their bodies and is often some shade of brown or grey.  Pack horses may not be pretty but are very useful."

    "hist": {
        "en": "The great bean farmer Jon Veldacks, as the tale goes, was the first to use a horse as a pack animal.  This discovery did not come without trial and error.  He first tried a rabbit, but it was crushed when the farmer dropped the first load of carrots on the little bunny's back.  Obviously Farmer Jon was not one for thinking ahead.  His next experiment was on his pet dog.  This experiment did not go well… let's just leave it at that.  Finally, after his son captured a wild horse, Veldacks built a harness for the horse.  This was exactly what he was looking for and the pack horse was born.  This “fad” (as some called it) turned into a great invention.  Sadly Jon died before credit was given to him, but his son made a fortune!"
