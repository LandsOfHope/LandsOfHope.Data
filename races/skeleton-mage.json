        "en": "Skeleton Magi are not only those that were spell casters in their previous lifetime, but they are also those that were imbued with that ability after they were reanimated. Some necromancers summon the creatures to do their bidding when the simple grunts that are skeleton warriors simply wonâ€™t do the job. Some of the skeleton magi can even summon up more skeletons to do their bidding, and, therefore, their master's bidding as well.   Skeleton Magi can cast a variety of spells, mainly from whatever spell school their master wills. The skeleton magi are dangerous, yet can be overcome. Only skilled adventurers, however, should try to combat these creatures."

        "en": "Like their minions and fellow walking dead, skeleton mages look like exactly that: skeletons. There is a key difference, however. They frequently seem to have glowing balls of flame surrounding the bones of their fists. These are pure, raw magical power, used to control other skeletons, or cast whatever spell they need to. Occasionally, they are seen wearing scraps of clothing, as heavier, metal armor would restrict their movement, thus restricting their ability to cast spells."

They have served as the front line magic users in large scale battles, or have been behind scenes commanders in smaller skirmishes. They have frequently been the reason the Reapers have won battles. While they distracted the enemy, the more powerful spell casters would prepare the immensely powerful spells that would, in the end, finish their opponents. "
