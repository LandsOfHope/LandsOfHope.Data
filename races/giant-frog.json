        "en": "Giant frogs appear just like their smaller cousins but in a larger package.  Bulbous heads with bulging eyes top rounded bodies with soft skin in shades of greens and browns.  Long legs allow the giant frogs to leap great distances in a single bound. Giant Frogs are shy creatures who hide in nests but the vast size of the nests make it easy for them to be found."

    "hist": {
        "en": "Early in history, the Giant Frog was thought to be a demonic creature because of its size.  Many avoided these animals fearing to be thought of as insects by the frogs. It wasn`t until a young enterprising beastmaster named Damian Blunderstorm needed to get across the country fast that the image of the Giant Frog was changed.  He tamed a young Giant Frog and with the dexterity and speed of that creature, he was able to deliver his message in time.  After that first extremely dangerous and bumpy ride, Damian became well known for inventing frog harness."
