        "en": "Cyclops are a very unusual species.  They are the only humanoid race that has one eye.  The Cyclops have a very developed civilization and their main trade is mining. Most Cyclops individuals have little to do with the other races of Myzan but some have been known to venture out into the greater world."

        "en": "The Cyclops are extremely strong.  They have one eye centered above their nose and large, pointed ears.  The males have massive shoulder and arm muscles from carving large mines and digging deep holes searching for ore.  The females are just as strong as the men but have a more delicate build despite being as large as the men. Both the men and the women tattoo themselves with a dye created from the powder of the lapis lazuli gem and berry juices.  Odd designs and swirls combine to make the  Cyclops an unusual and beautiful sight despite the oddity of their single eye."
