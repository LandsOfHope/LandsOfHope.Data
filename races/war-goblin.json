        "en": "The term goblin is a collective noun for evil spirits like redcaps and bugbears. They are usually grotesque and misshappen but are of human form. They live in dark places and are of a very mischievous nature. It is said that their smile curdles the blood, and that their laugh causes milk to sour and causes fruit to fall off trees. Typically, they only cause slight inconveniences like nightmares, but at times they can be very dangerous."
