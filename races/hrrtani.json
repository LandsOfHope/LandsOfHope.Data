        "en": "The Hrrtani race live in the sandy and clay parts of Myzan.  A primitive race, the Hrrtani make their homes out of caves in the ground.  They are very social so certain areas of Myzan almost seem to be nothing but holes in the ground as the Hrrtani tend to live very close to one another."

        "en": "  A Hrrtani is a small humanoid being.  With a tiny rodent like face and a sleek furry upright body the Hrrtani makes a strangely attractive creature.  Very quick and agile, the Hrrtani has the ability to see far into the distance and has developed excellent hearing making it a good hunter."

    "hist": {
        "en": "Although the Hrrtani race tends to keep themselves isolated there have been a few that were brave enough to leave home and serve Myzan.  One of the most famous was a youngling by the name of Trkkysta who was a scout for the exiles.  His abilities saved the lives of his band many a time during his time with the troop.  For years the Hrrtani have been known as a prankster race.  Stealthy and sly, they have a well developed sense of humor and love to play jokes upon those who wander near their homes."
