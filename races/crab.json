        "en": "Crabs are well armored beasts with five pairs of walking legs of which the front pair are formed into defensive claws.  They bear a flat armored shell which protects their abdomens from predators.  A crab is a nervous creature that will run for its hole when danger approaches but will defend itself when cornered."

        "en": "Crabs have been considered a delicacy near sea towns and at one time were almost hunted out of existance.  It was only when corpses found on beaches lay there rotting and stenching that it was understood that crabs played an important part of keeping Myzan clean.  Still considered a great source of food, the crab is also protected as a scavenger and it is slowly rebuilding as a species."
