        "en": "Mermaids live within the salty waters of Myzan in vast underwater cities. They are  known as the hunters of the deep. They rarely interact with the land bound species  of the world and have a complex civilization hidden far from human eyes. Most   mermaids never approach the surface though rare sightings have been reported."

        "en": "Mermaids have the upper body of humans and the lower body of a fish.  Though  this seems to be an odd combination it makes the merfolk extremely graceful in  the water.  They have gills behind their ears which allow them to live and breath  below the surface.  Scholars argue about whether the young are born live or hatched  from eggs. The females are slim and bedeck themselves with jewels of the seas.  The males have a bulkier body but still have the grace and beauty of the merfolk."

    "hist": {
        "en": "No one knows the true beginnings of the merfolk people but they predate the  humans of Myzan. Many myths and legends exist describing how they were once  human. In one such legend it is said a tragedy caused a woman to toss   herself into the sea but her beauty was so great that the gods decided to change  her rather than let her die.  In times of danger for Myzan the rulers of the seas have  been known to raise the merfolk to war.  Vast battles on the seas were affected by  the cunning and skill of the merfolk. It has been years since the mermaids have  felt the need to join in with the humans. Today many people now believe them to be  only a myth though the fishers of Myzan know the truth."
