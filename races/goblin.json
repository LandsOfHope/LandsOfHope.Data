        "en": "With skins the color of grass and dried sage, the goblins blend in well with the territory they dwell in.  Many an explorer has been surprised by a goblin jumping out of shrubbery and attacking them.  Goblins have very long fingers and feet which makes them very agile in picking pockets and fleeing.  Most people avoid them like the plague when they visit the cities and towns.  With long pointed ears and wide tooth filled mouths, a goblin has a face only its mother could love...maybe."

        "en": "Throughout history the goblin race has been deeply involved in fomenting rebellions and war.  Greedy creatures, they do their best to make the other races of Myzan fight with one another so the goblins can follow behind and reap the benefits like scavengers.  They have their own language that not one scholar in all of Myzan has been able to decipher.  Historically, the goblins have been the greatest troublemakers of Myzan."
