        "en": "Sleek and graceful are Preystalkers. They can grow up to eight feet long and easily stand to a mans height. Their coats are thick but not shaggy, keeping them warm when hunting in even the coldest climates. Many hunters train their Preystalkers to be mounted because keeping up with the cat during a hunt is a tricky thing to do because of its speed."

        "en": "A supreme hunter in its own right, the preystalker has been around for centuries. It is related to the saber-toothed cats of old, and even the species that survived in Juratania. No one is sure who domesticated the first preystalker, but there is a growing market for them as criminals become more common in the lands of Myzan."
