They have only been sighted during a short period of Myzan's history, and the heroes of the land quickly defeated these menaces. It is said they are divine retribution brought down by the deity known as Decius, destroying those unworthy, and rewarding those brave enough to defeat them."

        "en": "They are rather tall and lumberous. Smelling faintly of flour and chocolate. They appear to made from some pure form of chocolate chip cookie dough not before seen in Myzan. They also use a once unheard of magic involving bad hygiene food preparation and overcooking meals."

Some say Nioxis had a creative streak of insanity, while others claim they are sent from the heavens by Decius to protect all the innocent baked goods, especially cookies of all kinds. What is known is they only started appearing recently around the festival to celebrate Myzan's birth out of the great Void that is recognized by all allegiances and races. The appearance of these monsters lead some to speculate on the existence of an elemental plane devoted to baked goods."
