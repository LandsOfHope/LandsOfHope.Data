        "en": "The seas of Myzan are full of diverse and interesting wildlife.  Among the oddest and most interesting is the octopus.  An octopus is a large and very strange animal.  It has eight long tentacles covered with suction cups on one side.  These tentacles are supported by a large blob of a body that houses all of the organs.  Out of the water they are just disgusting and useless but underwater they are a fearsome enemy.  Many adventurers have perished when an angry octopus has latched onto their head and neck."

        "en": "Usually brightly colored, an octopus has eight strong tentacles and a bulbous body.  Each tentacle has suction cups on one side which are used to grip and hold things.  Most octopi choose to crawl along the bottom of the ocean using the tentacles to pull them along.  A large pair of eyes bulge from the front of their heads and give them a look of evil and cunning."

        "en": "Few tales are told of the Octopus.  Many land-dwellers still believe that they are a myth of the sea.  The few mariners that have lived through an encounter with an octopus tell that they are the evil spawn of the gods of the seas.  Such unusual and ugly creatures can only be bad portents for those who sail."
