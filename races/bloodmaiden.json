There is a good chance it was a bloodmaiden draining your will to fight. Bloodmaidens are attracted to battlefields, where they feed off the last hopes and willpower of the ones still alive, making them wish they weren't."

        "en": "While their succubi kin pursue their attractive looks, the Bloodmaidens do not. They have a horrifying visage. Many reports of death having a terrifying face actually come from people who have survived encounters with Bloodmaidens. Their wings are functional for short bursts of flight and gliding, but nothing sustained."

While they do not tempt their victims into giving up their life, Bloodmaidens scavenge battlefields and places of last resort, an easy meal with less work. An unknown elder warlock found a way to bind these scavengers to his service, and wrote the secrets down, hiding the scrolls away for future warlocks to discover."
