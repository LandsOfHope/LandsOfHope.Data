        "en": "The Watuman, unlike the merfolk, have a humanoid body.  They are slim and sleek, able to slip through the water with natural grace. Most Watuman have a blue-green skin and have very delicate features.  Large eyes dominate their faces along with fin-like ears.  They bear gills which allow them to breathe underwater and hunt for  extended periods of time.  Long, lanky arms that end with webbed fingers and powerful legs ending with webbed feet help them propel through the water."

Declaring her unending love for him, she threw herself into the ocean from the shores near Palmbay View while chanting  a wildlife spell, Swim with the Dolphins, on herself.  Somehow the spell went awry and the race of the watuman was born."
