        "en": "Many plants have been awakened by magic in the world of Myzan.  The muncher is among the most famous and common of these wakened plants.  Strong in combat and skilled in many types of weapons these plants are often used by druids as guardians.  They are carnivores but will also eat any dead wood around them.  The tell tale sign that you are in Muncher territory is the lack of large trees and bite marks on the surrounding foliage."

        "en": "Often mistaken for a beautiful flower, Munchers are many times the size of the small delicate flowers that cover the fields of Myzan.  They have a large flower head that is split in the middle and harbors large rows of teeth.  A long spindly stem supports the massive head and carries the leaves that are used as hands.  Munchers have the ability to uproot themselves and move but are quite slow."

    "hist": {
        "en": "Although many have claimed to be the first to awaken plants, druids claim this honor alone.  They brought many plants to life but the first was the muncher.  A large problem arose when the Munchers began multiplying rapidly.  Common food sources began to disappear and the munchers were desolating the ground around them.  Many forests died as a result.  So in response the druids magically modified the plants to be carnivores.  They figured that this would help control the animal population as well as the plants.  They did not count on the munchers gaining a taste for wood.  Therefore  they began to destroy large numbers of the plants and carefully controlling their breeding."
