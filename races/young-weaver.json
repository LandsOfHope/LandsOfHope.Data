        "en": "The Young Weavers are the offspring of the Weavers. They hatch from eggs in the lair of the adult weaver in the late spring and form hordes of ravaging and starving creatures.  Born hungry, they run in a path of destruction, mindless mouths searching for food of any kind. Strong, well-armed warriors have been known to fall to these hordes."

        "en": "Young weavers are formed much like the adults of their species.  In a way, they are even more difficult to look upon as they have the torso and head of a young child upon the body of a spider.  Instead of the dark color of the adult weaver, the young weaver is often a pale lavender or pinkish shade.  Standing only three feet tall, the young weaver is a dexterious creature able to jump distances of over ten feet and change  directions instantaneously."

    "hist": {
        "en": "Through the years spring has been a time of fear. Settlements bring their minions inside the protective walls and can only watch as the hordes destroy their budding crops.  Mindless with hunger, the young weavers eat everything in sight, often  battling and killing each other for any small portion of food.  As their hunger is sated  the young weaver`s instincts call them back to the forests the species call home.  The few survivors burrow deep in the darkest areas building lairs of their own where they grow to be adults, lay eggs of their own and continue the cycle of the weavers lives.  More of their history can be learned by researching the Myzan ledgers for information  on the weavers."
