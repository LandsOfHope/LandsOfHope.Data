        "en": "Sea dragons bear long, elegant fins instead of bulky climbing limbs with claws.  A sinuous body helps them to propel through water with grace and a fluid elegance.  Like the lesser water creatures, the sea dragon is an egg laying creature.  The female dragon guards the nest while the male hunts for food.  The sea dragon is a quick and agile creature and very protective over its young."

        "en": "The first sea dragon spotted gave way to stories of monsters in the depths of the waters of Myzan.  It took a long time for people to believe they really exist.  Perhaps this knowledge was hindered by the way the tale was spread.  Frederick SprawlBelly was overheard as he slumped over a bench in the Old Wooden Leg tavern muttering about demons and monsters into his cup. It took several years before his \"wild tales\" were proven as fact but by that time his reputation and life were in shreds."
