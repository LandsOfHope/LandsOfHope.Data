        "en": "Gyrians are a monogamous race that treasure their mates and offspring.  Although they are generally a gentle race they have been known to turn quite ferocious and protective defending their families and their home.  Gyrians are much the same size as humans but their bones are quite fragile and not as dense as the humans which enables them to take flight and sustain it.  They have wings that span up to six feet from tip to tip and are covered with beautiful feathers and soft down. Rather than hair on their heads, they have long feathery plumes."

        "en": "These creatures have lived on Myzan since the beginning of time.  It wasn`t until the  humans spread out and explored more areas that sightings of them occurred. Although as a race, the Gyrians are shy and retiring, individuals have been known to pull pranks and mischievous tricks on humans.    It has long been believed that the gyrians are the most intelligent beings on Myzan.  Many a magic user has searched long and hard for a single feather of one to attempt   to create a potion that will increase their intelligence and mana."
