        "en": "Part of the Reaper's aerial arsenal, ghouls are vampiric bat-like creatures that can often be seen flying over the darkened peaks of Barren Downs.  They are vile and menacing angels of the night, known to swoop down on unsuspecting caravans and convoys.   They will kill all that breathes to satisfy their thirst for blood.  Their natural nocturnal inclination, ability to fly, and superior hearing make ghouls ideal for aerial recon and scouting."

        "en": "Ghouls are very much like man-sized bats.  Most ghouls have a very humanoid body shape, often quite muscular.  Females tend be more slender than males.  They stand upright on their legs; their feet clawed and able to grasp hold of tree limbs and rock faces for perching.  Extending from their arms from the wrist to the shoulder blades are bat-like wings, thin and light, that grant the ghoul its flight.  Their faces are very similar to those of bats: up-turned noses, tight mouths full of sharp teeth, and large, pointed ears somewhat high and aback on the head.  Their eyes are like glowing beads, however it is unknown how well ghouls can see; their hearing is exceptional."

        "en": "Many people believe that vampires can transform into bats and sneak into and out of bedrooms at night, victimizing whomever they find was foolish enough to leave the window unbarred.  This perception is totally false, for vampires have no such ability to physically change their appearance.  They are able, however, to manipulate the perceptions of a victim through mental suggestion.  The “vampire bat” myth came about through a misunderstanding of the ghoul in human culture.  Ghouls were a rare sight until the rise of the First Horde, when ghouls - lesser relatives of the race of vampires - were used as advance raiders.  They were ordered by their commanders, who often were vampires themselves, to descend upon towns and villages for the sole purpose to kill, and to do so quickly and quietly.  The ghouls then developed the practice of feeding on people while they slept in their own beds.  When the town awoke from its nightly slumber, it would find entire families gone, bedrooms and chambers flooded with blood, with little or no evidence as to who or what the murderer was.  Needless to say, the Reapers found this fear and confusion vastly entertaining."
