        "en": "Water Cows the graceful and peaceful animals of the sea, glide gracefully through the waters of Myzan.  These slow but beautiful creatures are often mistaken for mermaids.  Of course, you should never tell a mermaid that.  Observers of the great beasts of the sea first notice the fins in place of legs.  Their cow shaped body swimming in the sea has led many sailors, usually suffering from dehydration, to believe that Water Cows are the horrific ghosts of past meals coming back to haunt them.  In any case, Water cows, when provoked, can be a formidable opponent."

        "en": "Big bodied with stubby fins, the Water Cow can grow quite large.  The males can be up to 10-12 feet long and very heavy.  Their wide bodies move smoothly through the water.  A Water Cow's face is rather short with wide jowls and whiskers.  In place of legs these beautiful creatures have fins.  Colors vary in the skins of the Water Cow, though most are the color of the sand in the sea."

        "en": "The renowned marine explorer Jack Coaster first sighted the Water Cow in a voyage to find sea monkeys.  Although unsuccessful in his search for the monkeys, he became famous for the Water Cows.  An excerpt from his journal describes the first encounter…  \"My fruitless search for the majestic see minkey has come up fruitless!  This crew is quite incompetent.  The only thing we have discovered is the cow of the seas.  I shall name it…  Water Cow!  He he, I love it.  If I must become famous from this…  I must but I shall not enjoy it…  no…  I shall not.\"    As you can see Coaster was not as thrilled about his discovery as many would have been. This is the first recorded experience with the Water Cow."
