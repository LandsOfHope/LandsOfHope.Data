        "en": "The Slammerkin are a large humanoid race known for their ability to mine and cut massive stone blocks from the earth. They live in the frozen areas of Coldfreeze. Strong foes, they wear plate armor they smith from the ores they find deep in the ground and many a warrior has outfitted himself with fine armor by defeating a  slammerkin.  One can usually find a large sack of rocks nearby after a fight."

        "en": "The Slammerkin are a large race with coarse features.  Rough skin in various shades of purples give them a strange look.  Arching eyebrows and open mouths with large gaps between the teeth give them a stupid appearance which can be fatal when a warrior underestimates them.  Massive muscles ripple under their armor formed from  years of working stone and ore.  The tallest Slammerkin stands around five feet tall but the bulk of their bodies make them appear larger."

        "en": "The Slammerkin are not a well known race and the history of how they came to be is not known.  Little of their society has been understood as they are a race that prefer to keep to themselves. In fact, it wasn`t until a shaman accidently trapped a  slammerkin in a soul gem and released it in a copper mine that they were discovered."
