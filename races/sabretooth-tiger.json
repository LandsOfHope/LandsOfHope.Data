        "en": "Growing up to eight feet long, and close to nine hundred pounds, the sabretooth tiger is a dangerous predator. Their two prominent canines, more like daggers then teeth, can grow up to nearly a foot long and combined with their jaw strength, can pierce most non metallic armors. They are powerfully built, and if tamed can even support heavy riders."

        "en": "Records of the Three Glaciers area tell that these predators still roamed those icy plains only a few thousand years before. The ones discovered in Juratania by the Eversight expedition didn't have the thick fur of their cousins, it thinning in the tropical climate."
