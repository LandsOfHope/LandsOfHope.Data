        "en": "Eels are supple, snake-like creatures that swim quickly through water and slither through tall grasses.  They bear a head that has strong jaws with many small, pointed teeth that can grasp prey with a deadly grip.  A small crest runs from its head down to its tail.  The body of the eel becomes more slender towards the tail."

    "hist": {
        "en": "The eel has long been a favored food for the wealthy.  At one time, the eel was almost hunted out of existance.  One elderly druid, Tarragon Buckthorn, dared to speak sternly  to the royal family and put the eel under his personal protection and since that day, the eel has managed to revive its species as an important part of the life cycle of Myzan."
