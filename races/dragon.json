        "en": "Dragons are a breed of extremely large, hard-scaled, winged lizards. Very powerful, and even intelligent to the level of Humans, these beasts are very dangerous. They hatch from eggs, knowing how to fly from birth. Rarely will one find more than four or five in one general area. While they do sometimes congregate for mating reasons, they are mainly solitary creatures. Also, they mate for life. There is said to be a physical as well as psychic connection between mated dragons. When one of the pair dies, through age, which is rarely the case, or battle, the other is rumored to either seek vengeance or simply die from sheer emptiness inside. Only a powerful, and very confident, adventurer will adventure into a dragon's lair. Most will not live to leave the cave, having been ripped apart by the dragon's claws, or burned to a crisp from the dragon's breath of flame.Their roar can be deafening, even hundreds of yards away.

        "en": "Long, tall, and clawed, dragons fly with their long, veined wings. They are said to sometimes lie in waiting for some prey to come by, using their large, extremely sharp claws to rip their meal to pieces, holding it down with their giant legs as they use their equally sharp jaws to pull the creature apart. Other times they may simply toast an enemy with sheets of flame from their mouths. Dragons come in every size, shape, and color. Their scales sometimes shine like gems, attracting many an unaware adventurer. A dragon`s scales dull as it ages. "

        "en": "The exact age of the dragon race is unknown. They came to Myzan long before any living creature can remember. They live in almost all of the realms, from the rocky mountainsides of Knotwood Valley, to the empty wastes of the Barren Downs. There are few of the dragons who actually have memories that are even close to the time the dragons came to these lands. They have long battled with the Dwarves of Myzan, having won a few wars and lost several more. This wondrous race is scattered throughout Myzan after the last few wars and battles against the differing races. One day, this powerful race of beasts may come back into fruition in Myzan. Until then, they wait."
