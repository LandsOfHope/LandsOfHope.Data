        "en": "Often the subject of young necromancers, Skeletons are rather fragile yet can be very powerful.  Young adventurers can find the layers of skeletons quite the challenge.  They are quite frightening when first encountered.  Rattling bones is usually the first sound you hear when a skeleton is near by.  A skeleton's strength is in its magic and thinness.  The magic powers it but it is so thin it is often a hard target to hit.  Fortunately, a couple of good whacks from a decent weapon will bring down any skeleton."

        "en": "Skeletons are all skin and bonesâ€¦without the skin.  Years and years of decay have stripped the bones of the flesh that once adorned them.  The ground that eats away at the bones has bleached them giving skeletons an uncanny glowing look, especially at night.  The bones can vary in size and shape, based on the race of the creature that the bones came from."

        "en": "Necromancy has been an art practiced since the discovery of the magics.  Skeletons being a weak creature, seemed the simplest form to resurrect.  Though this is true, many beginning necromancers have been injured and even killed by a skeleton minion.  A certain powerful necromancer was once overwhelmed and killed by his own skeleton army when they demanded workers rights and food.  Though this seems peculiar, it shows the unpredictability and dangers of dark necromancy."
