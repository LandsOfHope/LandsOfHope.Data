        "en": "Tough but slow, turtles carry a shield on their backs at all times.  This natural defense makes them a difficult foe to hit let alone hurt.  When scared, the turtle can pull it's appendages into the shell forming a nearly indestructible “box.”    When an attacker has worn itself down trying to break the turtle's defenses, the creature unfolds itself and attacks the exhausted enemy.  Remarkably, if a turtle survives enemies,  it can live for hundreds of years."

        "en": "The most prominent feature of a turtle is its domed shell.  In fact that's about all you can see of these creatures.  They have small clawed legs that are incredibly strong and can support immense weights when compared to its body.  Its head sticks out of the front of its shells where an upper and lower shell meet.  Also, a small stubby tail protrudes from the back of the shell.  Although turtles come in many colors, many are greenish hues.  They often have patterns on their shells of different shades of color."

        "en": "The ancients believed that turtles were the shields of the gods.  Legend has it that there once was a great battle between to factions on the gods.  When one side fell in battle their enchanted shields sprouted legs and walked away from the battle.  They became turtles.  Nowadays, some intelligent turtles ironically teach shield skills to warriors.  This could make the connection to the legend a reality."
