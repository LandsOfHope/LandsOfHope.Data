Jackals are often seen slinking off into the shadows dragging rotting arms or chunks of flesh thus gaining the reputation of scavengers."

        "en": "Jackals are doglike animals with large ears and bushy tails.  They come in shades of  gold, silver or black and are stocky creatures that communicate with yips and howls. Creatures of the night, they have been known to hunt small animals and have been a pest to farmers who raise sheep.  Jackals move rapidly but can come to a dead stop, noses in the air sniffing out meals, then in a flash disappear into the shadows once again."
