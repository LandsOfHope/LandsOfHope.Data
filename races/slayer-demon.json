        "en": "They appear almost dragonlike but that is where the similarity ends. Their glowing eyes are able to see through most mortal forms of invisibility, and they are keen at tracking down their prey. Long necks provide great reach with their fanged jaws. While bestial in appearance they are highly intelligent, able to call forth the power of the hellish planes to overcome their foes."

        "en": "Slayer Demons are an ancient creature on Myzan, stories go back many centuries. While most have not seen one in just as many years, they are still talked about. Though recently, two apparent subspecies have been showing up to terrorize Myzan, the Devourer of Might and the Devourer of Magic. Neither subspecies seems to be natural, and both types claim to serve a master named Nioxis."
