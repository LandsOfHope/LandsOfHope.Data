        "en": "The basilisk is a fairly common lizard found in the jungles and forested areas of Myzan. Other species exist however and have been spotted in other terrain rarely. They are aggressive if they feel threatened, but generally avoid humans and other species unless provoked. They prefer solid ground under their clawed feet, but there are rumors of ones that can actually walk on water."

        "en": "They are a rather large lizard, ranging from a little over three feet to close to ten or eleven feet. Females tend to be a bit more colorful then the males unlike some other species. Their scales are fine and smooth; sometimes more highly sought for clothing then snakeskin."

        "en": "Many stories are told of the Basilisk, and most of them are just that, stories. Basilisks are an old species on Myzan. Some even claim they predate the earliest dragons. The truth has been lost in history. There are thoughts that they might even be related to the saurians found in Juratania."
