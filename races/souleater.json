        "en": "The Souleaters are cousins of the Lifetakers. They hunt the mortal plane and draw out the very essence of a creature; this causes the loss of magical ability temporarily. The Sustained feeding by a soultaker on a subject can completely destroy the subjects ability to call forth energies from other elemental planes. Large caches and uses of mana tend to draw them like moths to a flame."

        "en": "On the mortal plane, they normally have no physical or visible substance or body. When a warlock performs the rite to bind them to this plane, they take on the physical form of the candle flame used to summon them. Much like their Lifetaker cousins, no one knows why they choose their color."

        "en": "The Souleaters have always hunted our plane. It wasn't until, a few centuries ago, research warlocks brought them into the visible spectrum to see what was hindering their high mana experiments. Since then, warlocks have developed rites to bind these onto our plane and have them do their bidding. Their ability to drain the mana from a subject and impart it onto the warlock is a prized asset in certain situations."
