While not the most intimidating creature, it is apt at scarring children, the elderly and small animals with its tricks and bumping in the night. It is thought that they actually feed and gain life from those they scare."

The sharp claws and teeth do not seem to have the normal functions as other creatures as they do not feed on physical substances and appear only to be used to scare people more."
