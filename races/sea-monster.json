        "en": "Sea monsters range in many shapes and sizes, but the most common one seen is a large serpentine-bodied creature with horns and rows of razor sharp teeth meant for skewering prey. Like some other species of marine life they apparently can change their body color to differentiate males from females."

        "en": "Through Myzan`s history Sea Monsters were regarded as fairy tales. That is until Captain Clark of the Morlark returned with reports of the creatures. He smelt heavily of rum, and he did look to have gotten a tad too much sun, but the story of a single beast destroying a whole convoy of merchant ships was believable when local healers pulled a rather large tooth from his leg unlike any seen before."
