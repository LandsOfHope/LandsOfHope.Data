        "en": "Drakes and Dragons, while closely related, are very different.  While dragons are very large with a long neck and body, drakes are rather short and stocky.  Also the temperament of a drake is much more calm and peaceful yet they can become quite fierce when provoked.  Drakes are often used as minions and are very loyal to their masters.  Drakes are able to carry humanoids on land and in the air."

        "en": "Many non-adventurers mistake the drake for a baby dragon.  They have nearly all the same features of a dragon except that they have short necks and bodies and are only about the size of a large cow.  Drakes have small armor like scales and a signature beak-like snout that is very strong.  Although coloring varies, most are shades of red and blue."

    "hist": {
        "en": "It is told that at one time there were two great dragonmasters.  They were twin siblings but as different as night and day.  One loved destruction and death, Balt, and the other loved peace and harmony, Ona.  They were often at odds with each other but also realized that they needed each other to survive.  Each secretly, or so they believed, competed for the love of their parents by breeding dragons.  They each also bred the dragons to what they loved and while Baltâ€™s dragons kept their original form they became more wild and deadly.  Ona on the other hand created a new species of dragon called the drake which was calmer and gentler than their cousins."
