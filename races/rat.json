Rats are known to be collectors of shiny objects which can lead to small treasures.  A rat tail can be quite the trophy  to some younger adventurers.  The faint squeak of a rat in the dark has frightened more than a few heroes."

        "en": "Rats have small, compact bodies.  They are usually fat looking and their bodies can grow up to 12 inches long.  The tail is usually as long as the body and is thin.  These creatures have the strange ability to compress their bodies into unbelievably small spaces which make them great thieveâ€™s assistants.  They can be many different colors from white to brown to black and everything in between."

        "en": "The first human killed by rats was found with thousands of small bites all over his body.  His armor was stripped from him and set beside his body.  All of his coins were scavenged from his bag and his weapons were carried away.  This horrific scene was discovered by some children that happened to see some of the man's attackers scurrying away as they approached.  The young man's death sparked the great rat massacre of Northglen and a war that has dragged on for many years, though most are unaware of it."
