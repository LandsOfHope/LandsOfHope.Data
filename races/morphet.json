        "en": "Morphets are a shy, cautious race. Their true form is that of a small winged dragon like creature. They are highly intelligent, but most are skittish. Their evolution on Myzan has allowed them to gain the abilities to mimic not only the form, but also many other traits and aspects of other creatures to better hide and protect it. Never assume something is what you think, it could just be a morphet hiding."

        "en": "Their skin is soft and subtle, having very fine scales. Their wings are functional, allowing them flight. In their natural form, morphets are colorfully distinct between the genders. When hiding, they can perfectly mimic whatever they wish to hide as with very few telltale signs. "
