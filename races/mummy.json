Among the other vile nightly creatures that can be found lurking in and around vast tombs and cemeteries there are mummies, the reanimated corpses of the ceremonially entombed."

        "en": "Mummies are lean corpses that are often covered in a wrap of linens that, at the time of entombment, was soaked in an embalmment solution.  The body was also treated in an effort to preserve the deceased for as long as possible for the afterlife.  These creatures exist, therefore, because the preservation process was successful.  The soul of the dead may find his body too inviting or, perhaps, too difficult to leave behind. So he returns to his decaying flesh and is cursed to walk the earth a rotting, skeletal wrap of stale flesh and dirty, worn cloth, reduced to being a mindless, shuffling bag of aged, brittle bones."

        "en": "The mummy is the result of ancient Myzanese religion and ingenuity.  Some of Myzan’s oldest cultures have had religious beliefs that included some sort of afterlife.  In order to allow the soul to thoroughly enjoy death, certain religious practices required the body of the dead to be preserved.  Many different technologies were used to achieve this goal; the most common and successful technique involved the wrapping of the body in a series of ointment-soaked linens after undergoing an extensive purification process.  It is from this and similar techniques that advancements in food preservation such as smoking and salt bathing originated."
