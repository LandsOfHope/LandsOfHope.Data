        "en": "Sharks come in a variety of sizes.  The smallest is around seven inches long but the largest can be over fifty feet from its toothy jaws to its tail.  The average shark is usually about seven feet long.  Sharks have no bones but instead have a tough  cartilage which makes them a supple animal.  Their skin is rough and doesn`t have the scales of the more common fish.  The jaws of the shark are full of many teeth making it a fearsome beast to battle."

        "en": "Sharks have long hunted the oceans of Myzan. Tales have been told of giant sharks that  measured over a hundred feet in length that sank mighty ships.  No one has ever found proof of these legendary fish but the tales continue to circulate.  Many crusty fishermen wear jewerly made from the teeth of the shark and say that capturing a shark for the first time is the only way a true fisherman can become a real man."
