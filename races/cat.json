        "en": "Cats are one of the most beloved pets of young girls.  They are cute and furry and make people very happy.  Often though, they have a dark side.  A deep hatred of all creatures that walk on two legs boils beneath the surface.  This hatred is only cooled by the need for food and shelter.  Of course if a cat were motivated they could provide these things for themselves but being lazy creatures, they would rather not."

        "en": "Furry and four legged felines, cats have a long tail that is constantly in motion.  Most cat lovers believe that they can read emotion in the tail.  The face of a cat features a small compact nose, small pointy ears, and odd evil looking eyes.  The pupils are diamond like slits in a fierce looking eye.  They often have the look of indifferent cruelty.  The fur is very soft and varies in color."

    "hist": {
        "en": "Many believe that the cats’ hatred for two legged creatures stems from an “accidental” shape shift.  Long ago, when magic was first being discovered and refined, a young man named Stavo stumbled upon the ability to change form.  His spells could change anyone into anything.  One day an evil “friend” of the shape shifter decided to steal the shape shifting spells.  He was caught in the act by Stavo and an argument ensued.  They began to tug back and forth at the spell book and both started reading the spell in hopes of turning the other into something random.  They both made a mistake in the recital and turned each other into cats.  Sadly they became stuck in this form and the spell was lost.  The evil friend then attacked and killed Stavo and began to spread hatred among the cats.  In one day great magic and a great mage were lost and an entire species was tainted."
