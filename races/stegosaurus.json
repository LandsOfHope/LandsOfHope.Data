Many expedition personal have been injured in encounters with these beasts. Though when observations have been made, they seem rather docile, more content to eat the various plant life of Juratania than attack things."

The Eversight expedition ran into living specimens in Juratania and was amazed. First that these creatures were thriving here, and second at how fast it could whip its spiked tail at them."
