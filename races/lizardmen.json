Lizardmen are the strange mixture of man and lizard.  This odd combination could only have happened as a result of magic.  As a race, lizardmen seem to be cultured and intelligent.  They take to making their own clothes, jewelry, and homes.  Lizardmen even create art, literature and music.  The common misconception with these creatures is language and speech.  Humans often believe them to be unintelligent because they cannot use common speech very well.  This view is very wrong as Lizardmen have their own language yet can learn others."

        "en": "With the body of a human and the head of a large crested lizard, Lizardmen can be very intimidating sights.  Their bodies are usually covered with scales colored in greens and browns.  Lizardmen have a long snout and small eyes that exude intelligence.  The bite of a lizrdman is slightly toxic."

    "hist": {
        "en": "The obscure and mysterious history of the Lizardmen is one that is hidden by many years of tradition passed through the generations.  Lizardmen have always kept careful record and have been even more careful not to tell others how they began.  Some snippets of the story have been discovered but no real evidence of the truth exists.  Only one real piece of tradition has been uncovered by a very unlucky story teller.  He writes in his journal that he had discovered the history of the lizardmen by means of a very clever disguise.  Unfortunately, before he was able to translate this history he was assassinated and the manuscript was stolen."
