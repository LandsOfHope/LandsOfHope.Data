        "en": "Sleek and agile, the raptor is the perfect example of a hunter at the top of its food chain. Females tend to be slightly larger then the males. Both though have very sharp claws, especially on the inner toes, using it to slash at prey, leaving deep, bleeding gashes.  Their jaws are also strong, with teeth that can easily rip flesh and meat away from prey."
