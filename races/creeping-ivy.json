        "en": "The Creeping Ivy is a bush-like plant with many small stems and leafs that run off the  main stem.  A large, toothed jaw tops the ivy`s body giving it a deadly deadly appearance.  Tiny roots at the base of the plant writhe and wiggle giving this plant its mobility.    Although the Creeping Ivy only stands a few feet tall, it still can cause havoc where  ever it goes because it never travels alone."

        "en": "During the Great War many odd beings were created in order to cause major disruptions and the Creeping Ivy was one of them.  The mage who decided on the ivy plant for this figured that this wide spread plant would be perfect.  Found just about every where on Myzan, the ivy was easy to change.  What he didn`t take into account was the great hordes of uncontrollable pests that would ravage both sides of the battle.  Whole armies were scattered when this blood thirsty plant smelled the bloodletting  and swarmed the battleground.  Today the Creeping Ivy has been culled down quite a bit and now can only be found in certain areas of Myzan.  It is still a very dangerous plant and quite often after defeating one, residue such as earrings, hats and skeleton bones from vanquished foes can found within the plant` corpse."
