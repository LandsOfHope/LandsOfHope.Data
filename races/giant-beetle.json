        "en": "Giant beetles scuttle around the lands of Myzan devouring vast quantities of plant life.  Heavily armored, the giant beetle has few enemies that have the strength to take it down. Faster than expected, the beetle is dexterious and can defend itself well."

    "appr": {
        "en": "Giant beetles are very large animals and can measure over ten feet in length and weigh over 500 pounds.  Most of that weight is from the thick, armored carapace the beetle bears.  Six spindly barbed legs hold up the massive body and appear deceptively fragile.  Its head is small and has two fang-like pinchers protruding from the mouth area that enable it to defend itself.  Two wings top the main section of its body but the beetle rarely flies due to its great weight."

    "hist": {
        "en": "Many scholars believe that the giant beetle evolved naturally from the common beetle long ago and are now a separate branch of the beetle family.  They can be found in the muddy and dusty areas of Myzan proving their adaptability to their surroundings. Several enterprising souls have tamed the giant beetle and have found them to be  surprisingly defensive mounts during battle."
