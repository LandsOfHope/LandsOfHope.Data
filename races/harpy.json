        "en": "Nasty and evil, harpyâ€™s are often feared by any who see them.  These bird/human cross breeds will attack any who step into their territory.  Most harpy lairs are in mountainous areas.  They build their nests high up and away from any known trails which helps protect their young.  Many foolish adventurers, looking for fame, have tried to find a harpy nest and have died in the attempt."

        "en": "Sometimes the mixture of man and animal creates a stately and beautiful creature.  In the case of a harpy this does not hold true.  Even with the stately body of a bird the human parts are often deformed and ugly.  Many are repulsed by the look of these creatures.   The feathers cover all of the body except the face and can be many different colors."

    "hist": {
        "en": "A young druid spent her life studying harpys.  Her research has opened many eyes to these fearsome animals.  She claims that the harpy only attacks intruders because they are ashamed of their looks.  In an amazingly inventive and foolish attempt to enter the harpy territory the druid blindfolded herself.  She hoped that her blindness would help the harpys trust her.  Fortunately it worked and she was able to eventually study the creatures by sight and even in a rudimentary language.  Unfortunately, the young druid disappeared with all of her notes and was never seen again."
