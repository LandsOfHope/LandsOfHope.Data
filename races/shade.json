        "en": "Shades are strange creatures to behold.  They seem to almost float through the air and to appear out of no where.  They have no real form but instead their image changes from moment to moment as if blown out of shape by the wind.  There is no  way to determine the sex of a shade that has been found."

    "hist": {
        "en": "Shades were born of magic long ago when sorcerors first began experimenting with the elements of the world.  Their shape changing comes from being born of the air, thus their name as they seem to come out of the shadows when they attack.    Like the dragons, shades are attracted to gems.  If one manages to defeat a shade in battle most of the time a gem or two will be left behind once it`s body wafts away.    It is said that somehow the crystals of the desert come from some type of by-product of the shade`s existance though no one has determined what causes the shade to create the magical crystals.  Since the sithanu have claimed to be the guardians of the crystals, the shades have decided to declare war on the sithanu race as a whole.  If you come across a sithanu in the desert, be wary...a shade will not be too far away."
