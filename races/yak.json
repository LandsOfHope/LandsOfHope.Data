One winter she became angry when a handsome man turned down her marriage proposal.  The man was already in love which enraged the goddess so much that she caused a terrible blizzard that raged for months.  One day the young humans became lost in the wilderness.  The young man called out to the goddess begging for their lives.  The immortal agreed to help on the condition that he marries the goddess.  The man agreed but the cruel goddess turned the beautiful girl into an ugly Yak.  Though it saved the girl`s life she was condemned to walk the planet as a Yak and without her true love.  This, it is said, is how the race of Yaks was born."
