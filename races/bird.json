They are all egg bearing creatures that lay the eggs in nests of different types where both the male and the female take turns tending the eggs."

        "en": "Birds have a small head topping their bodies with eyes on each side and a beak that is stronger than it looks.  Their bodies, wings and tails are covered with feathers that come in a variety of colors depending on the species. They are creatures of the air and can dance on the wind with a grace unknown by any other animal on Myzan."

Wild birds have often provided hunters with a bit of variety in their meals.  Although the bird is a fragile and weak animal they have been known to turn ferocious when defending their nests."
