If a person has been   daring enough to mount a hellhound, he finds he has the ability to cross over lava and travel through fiery areas of Myzan and survive."

        "en": "Hellhounds are a horrid creature to behold.  Born of nightmares and dark visions,  they appear as massive dog-like animals with eyes that glow with an inner fire.  These eyes are often the first thing seen as they approach, glowing like pieces of coal. They have what seems to be a perpetual sneer bearing huge fangs.  Their pelts are dark in color which allows them to blend into the night`s shadows."

        "en": "Throughout history, the Hellhounds have been feared by mankind. Rumors of hellhounds running in Wild Hunts foretell of hard times to come, be it war or other disasters. Like any other creature of Myzan though, there has aways been the brave or foolhardy soul who has made a commitment to find one and tame it some how.  Many of these souls have never been seen again."
