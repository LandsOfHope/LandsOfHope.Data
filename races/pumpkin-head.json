        "en": "While most blame the Reapers for their creation as some kind of sick Halloween prank, the truth is far more grisly. Back when Knottwood was still known as Bonewood many gruesome deaths occurred in the constant struggles. The most gruesome of those being dubbed the field of blood, near the present day town of Springlade. Unknowing to this, the Baros built a farmstead and decided to grow pumpkins. The first All Hallows Eve the spirits long dormant stirred and possessed the poor gourds to lay their vengeance down on all around."
