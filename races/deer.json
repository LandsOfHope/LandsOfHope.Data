        "en": "Deer are four legged animals that stand smaller than the average horse.with the male deer being larger than the female.  They come in a variety of colors and shades, mostly reds and browns.  The young calves are born spotted to help them blend into their surrounding but these spots fade as they age. The male deer is unique in that he bears a bony growth called antlers on his head.  These make formidable weapons for the deer which he uses to protect his territory."
