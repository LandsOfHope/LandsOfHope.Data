        "en": "If there is anything more frightening than Death itself, it would be the legion of Bloody Reapers.  More aggressive and vengeful than the Grim variety, Bloody Reapers stalk the earth in search of souls to devour.  They are motivated by no cause other than bloodshed.  Most priests and exorcists agree that Bloody Reapers were once upholders of justice in the same vain as the greater Grim Reaper; however, these demons have developed a mad hunger for the violence they regularly brought to those who were most deserving of it.  It is now a desire, a lust, so strong that they now exist solely for devastation."

        "en": "In these dark times, it best not to try and discern the difference between a Grim Reaper and the smaller, more aggressive, Bloody Reaper.  Such wasted time in battle will surely mean certain death as both reapers look very similar and will not hesitate to strike down any foe before them.  Few engage a Grim Reaper in a fight and live to tell the tale, fewer still have survived an encounter with a Bloody Reaper.    Those who have lived through such a fight caution against a fight with these demons robed in hooded cloaks as dark as a starless night.  They say that the red glow that pours from their eyes is enough to cool the blood of any fierce warrior.  Its jaws chatter wildly in delight of its vile amusement - namely, death.  And its weapon of choice - a long, blood-stained sickle - is often described as nigh unbeatable, indeed, unnatural."

        "en": "Undoubtedly the pride of the First Horde, the legion of Bloody Reapers has spread terror and havoc throughout Myzan since the first Followers turned on the Light for Darkness.  After the defeat of the original Horde, the legion seemed to disappear.  Many had thought that the reapers had returned to the depths of the Underworld from whence it was believed they came.  In truth, they were waiting for the new breed of Undead to awaken from their graves.    Now there is talk of the return of the Red Death, advance units of the Horde bent on death and disruption, named and modeled after the Bloody Reapers of the First.  As the Reapers become more organized as a faction, it is believed that the Red Death units will become more of a threat, no longer attacking randomly causing panic, but striking in definite, purposed patterns in order instill fear while serving a true strategic purpose for the Horde proper.  It is unknown whether or not the Bloody Reaper legion will be apart of this movement, but the armies of Myzan will prepare for them just the same."
