This ghost can travel as normal and actually carry the items that were on the ghostâ€™s physical form.  Ghosts however cannot fight nor do anything physical.  A good healer can bring back the physical form of the ghost if they choose to be revived."

        "en": "These odd apparitions are often seen floating about with a trail of items following.  This makes it easy for any opportunistic wanderer to confiscate items.  Ghosts are often the faint outlines of the physical form they used to have.  These spirits tend to fade with time and if they are not revived within a certain amount of time the spirit will be lost forever."

        "en": "The phenomenon of ghosts has never been explained.  Many have tried and all have failed.  Well known philosopher Baron Von Glopennspeilenheim wrote a fantastic dissertation on ghosts that changed the way society looks at these apparitions. Unfortunately, only the Society members have access to this manuscript.  Surely, the piece teaches those who read it to exploit ghosts and their abilities."
