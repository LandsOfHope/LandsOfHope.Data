        "en": "Rabid dogs appear much the same as common dogs with small differences. They have a body with four legs and a bushy tail that is covered with thick, protective fur that usually comes in various shades of browns. The main differences are on the head area.  Instead of the brownish eyes of the   common dog, the eyes of the rabid dog are a pure red which seems to glow in the dark.  It also has massive fangs that have poison ducts much like snake fangs. Once a rabid dog bites down, it is almost impossible to break the jaws loose since they lock into place."

        "en": "Rabid dogs were created during a time of chaos when magics and strange diseases ran rampant through the world.  It is believed that a dog was bitten by a snake during a fight and wild magic changed the genetics of the dog.  From that day  forward the rabid dog was no longer an ill animal but a true breed with the poisonous ability part of its nature."
