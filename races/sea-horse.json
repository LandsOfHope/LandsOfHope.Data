        "en": "Most seahorses are tiny animals measuring the size of a man`s finger or less. They bear fins both on the lower body and on the head. A face with an long snout looking much like a horse`s head gives them their name. Their bodies end in a curled tail that grips sea plants anchoring them in place so they can feed. On a side note, the seahorse is the only known creature to exist where the male carries the eggs and gives birth to the young."

    "hist": {
        "en": "For the longest time seahorses were virtually unknown by Myzans because of their tiny size. Shy creatures, they hid in the lower reaches of the seas and were seldom seen.  A mage was crossing the southern ocean of Knotwood Valley when a freak storm  blew up and he was cast over the side.  The young man couldn`t swim and he quickly sank into the depths of the sea. Full of panic, he cast spells trying to save his life. One spell struck a group of tiny seahorses which caused them to grow to immense size. Throwing his arms around the neck of one of them he forced it to take him to the surface and to the shore of a tiny island in the middle of the ocean.    No one would ever have known why the giant seahorses appeared if a ship hadn`t   stopped one day at the island for repairs.  While searching for fresh fruits a sailor  came across a ruined hut and he found a journal inside.  \"My name is Denale Apprezzle and this is my story...\" the journal began.  No trace of the mages body was ever found."
