        "en": "Imps were originally thought to be taller, thinner pixies. The researcher Alexia Tribka studied them for many years when she discovered one day in an outing to the forests of Knottwood valley that they were indeed different. Unfortunately the Imps thought it was funny to fill her pack with raw meat and tell the local bear population that poor Alexia was a pi√±ata."
