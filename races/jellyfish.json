        "en": "A jellyfish has a bell shaped body that comes in a variety of colors.  Long tentacles stream from its body and dangle in the water as it drifts in the water.  The jellyfish uses these tentacles to sting and catch its prey.  Jellyfish can be so small that they can barely be seen and also as large as three feet across with tentacles that trail over nine feet in length.  Some species of jellyfish will glow in the dark.  Certain jellyfish have stingers on its tentacles that have a venom so powerful that it can kill a human."
