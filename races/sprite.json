They are curious, and will sometimes follow a creature for days, watching it and everything it does. Though they do not wish to harm the creature, just observe it."

        "en": "Their main body consists of a sphereical glob of unidentified matter. It illuminates, createing an aura around the Sprite. While it appears as light, the aura seems to be able to manipulate physical objects. Sprites communicate through this aura, dimming and brightening it in pulses. The only semblence of a face are two small bead like eyes."

While some schools teach the difference, many of the texts are out of date, and still have the sprites and wisps as the same species."
