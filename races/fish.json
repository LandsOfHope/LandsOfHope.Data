        "en": "All of the waters, from the smallest stream to the largest ocean are inhabited by fish.  They can grow to enormous sizes or can be as small as a finger.  Fish are caught and eaten by most people, as they are quite easily caught and cooked.  Some water loving adventurers have been known to battle with schools of fish."

        "en": "Although many species exist, fish are shaped very similar.  Long slender bodies carry no real appendages besides fins.  Most fish have a large tail fin, a dorsal fin sitting atop their spine, and smaller fins along the bottom and sides.  Fish have gills or gill slits on the sides of their bodies near where the head is.  Scales cover their entire body and can range in color from shiny silver to bright blues and reds."

    "hist": {
        "en": "Legends from all over the world tell of a great creator that made the planet and all of its inhabitants.  This god, who some call Decius, also had other gods that helped him.  One day the creator and his wife, the goddess Tekka, were walking through the lands that they had created.  As they crossed a stream they came upon a Dwarf.  Now Dwarves in those days were not as skilled as they are now and this Dwarf seemed to be particularly unskilled.  The only thing that he was good at was carving, which is not a valued skill in Dwarven culture.  The poor dwarf was alone and hungry and the kind god and goddess took pity on him.  Decius asked the Dwarf to tell his story.  As the dwarf did this Tekka whispered into Decius' ear and reminded him of the fish they had created the day before.  They asked the Dwarf to carve a long pole, some string and a hook.  The kind beings taught him to fish and cook.  This is the day that three skills were born; Tinkering, Fishing, and Cooking."
