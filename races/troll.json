        "en": "Trolls are tall beings with long arms and legs.  A troll has no hair nor eyebrows to speak of and has green, spotted skin.  Large ears stand up from its head and its eyes are large and red-rimmed which give it excellent hearing and sight.  The females  are slender and the males are quite muscled.  The male trolls have two bottom teeth which extend out of their mouths and gives them a fearsome appearance."

        "en": "Throughout history there have been stories told, mainly in children`s tales, about trolls who live under bridges, herd goats and eat children.  No proof of any of these have ever been found and it is believed these stories were started to keep children well behaved. Trolls who hear of these tales become highly offended. The Trolls have a  rugged type of civilization and society and like to believe that they have evolved past that kind of behavior.  As the famous, in his own eyes, troll Eargobbler once boasted, \"Me no eeet babieees.  Liesss, dey all liesss! Me eeet rocckkss!\""
