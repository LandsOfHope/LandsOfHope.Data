        "en": "Feared by most, spiders live horrible disgusting lives.  Spiders possess the ability to spin webs strong enough to catch and hold bugs and even small animals.  They also produce strong poisons that can kill a human.  These insects can control the amount of poison injected so that the prey isnâ€™t quite dead when it starts to feast.  Many of the strongest, toughest warriors run screaming from spiders."

        "en": "Often no bigger than a bronze piece, spiders have eight long legs and a three sectioned body.  The largest section is at the back which houses the poison and web spinners.  The next section holds vital organs and the final section is the head.  Spiders are often covered in tiny hairs and are colored in blacks and browns."

        "en": "Legends tell us that the spider was one link in a chain of events that may have spawned many different animals.  At first when an animal died it was left on the ground to rot.  After a while the stench overwhelmed the gods and they decided to make flies to eat the dead carcasses.  The flies did so well at eating the dead that they began to feast on the living for lack of food so the gods created spiders.  Well you can imagine that the spiders, being so well adapted at killing flies, overwhelmed the planet so the gods created birds to eat the flies.  Eventually after many new species and even a few natural disasters were created the gods found a semblance of balance and the world was given more variety."
