        "en": "Vampire Lords are the ruling class among the Reapers. They have a superior attitude, manner, and are the most powerful, mostly from age since they became undead. Rank in the Vampire society is frequently determined by contests of strength and mental prowess. The loser does not live. Vampire Lords have risen to the highest echelon of the groups. They make the decisions where to attack, where to feed, and where the other vampires will rest, even. The fights are very vicious when someone challenges a pack leader. No holds are barred. Everything goes. There is no 'cheap' attack when this happens. It is a fight to the second death."

        "en": "Their manner of dress is different. They wear fancier clothing and even talk in a loftier air than before they became that high in rank. They frequently act like nobility, whether they were of that station in life before they became one of the undead or not. They are stronger, fit, faster, thinner, and more powerful. They exert a command presence that is rarely questioned. Their hair is generally in a fancier style than their underlings. They are among what would be called “The Beautiful People” among humans."

        "en": "The history of the vampire lords is much the same as vampires themselves. They are the ruling class among the undead, including the zombies, werewolves, and other undead creatures. They have been and will be for as long as any person can tell. The leaders of each undead clan have changed many times over the centuries in Myzan. Every time one changes, history is shaped is some way or form. The leaders determine the policy, the policy determines the actions. Just like in human society… except with an 'exceptional' view for living beings as meals or undead fodder."
