        "en": "Legend has it that the Magnalian race was born during a wild lightning storm.  It is said that a piece of the heavens fell to the earth and landed in the heart of the magma just as a spike of lightning struck.  Created with the fire in their souls they have found little reason to step outside their territories and have had little true interaction with the human race."
