        "en": "Scorpions are beasts that have four pairs of walking legs and that bear two large claws in   front that they use to grasp their prey. They have a segmented tail that curves over its back which ends in a stinger. This stinger releases venom into a victim which can kill smaller animals and make larger ones very ill.  Scorpions wear a tough  armour around their body that protect them from pedators. Scorpions molt their shells as they grow larger in size."
