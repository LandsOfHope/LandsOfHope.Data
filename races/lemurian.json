        "en": "Lemurians are a humanoid race of Myzan that many deem to be distant cousins of the Elvan race.  The Lemurians dwell high in the mountainous ranges of Myzan.  Although the Lemurians are not a shy nor withdrawn race they are not one of the better known ones due to the difficulty of reaching their homelands.  They are known, however, to be very proud beings who consider honor to be the most important thing in life to achieve."

        "en": "The sight of a Lemurian gliding through the air far above the land is one that few forget.  Few races of Myzan have the innate grace of a Lemurian.  Tall and lanky with a fragile look to them, the Lemurian appears to be quite delicate in form.  With large pointed ears like the Elvan race, they have excellent hearing.  Beautiful white feathered wings sprout from their backs allowing them the wonder of flight. A Lemurian has excellent eye sight and can see many miles away while in flight.  Two antenna like appendages grow from their foreheads yet no one is really sure if they have a use."

        "en": "Lemurians settled long ago in the realm of Coldbreeze on the highest mountain peaks.  D`Shae^an Creeza was the first Lemurian to find his way into the Exile army and he became well known as the best archer ever seen.  With his ability to fly and his keen eyesight, D`Shae^an saved many squads of scouting Exiles."
