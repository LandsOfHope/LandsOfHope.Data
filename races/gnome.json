        "en": "Shorter than the dwarves, Gnomes are well known for being mischievous and easily angered.  They can also be surprisingly fierce warriors though a single hit can usually kill them.  Their small size and cunning make them excellent thieves.  They are used to the cold and most often use their fists though some have been known to use small knives."

        "en": "Gnomes are small humanoids that resemble elves.  They rarely grow taller than 15 inches.  Although they are small they have a lot of ingenuity, using many uncommon items for clothing.  Some use bits and pieces of cloth scavenged from garbage while others have the ability to tailor fine gnome clothing.  They often have light hair and bright eyes."

        "en": "“'No one messes with a Gnome!'  These were the first words out of the mouth of the tiny creature standing in the middle of my path.  He had gone mostly unnoticed by my horse while we walked along the lonely road.  His sword raised and he charged the hooves of my faithful steed.  Tunos stepped back, a little nervous, so I hopped down and stepped between him and the tiny attacker.  The Gnome stopped short and looked up at me.  'Out of my way knight I must slay this foul beast for defecating on the path that I was striding!'  I reached down and tried to grab at his waist and he hopped aside with great agility.  'Ha HA I am too fast for you knight!'  Time was being wasted by this rodent of a creature so I pulled my sword.  At this the Gnome whitened and scurried into the bushes.  I remounted Tunos and began to ride away.  I swear I heard a few small pebbles hit the back of my helmet but I chose to ignore it…”    Excerpt from “My Life as a Knight”  by F. A. Whitehand"
