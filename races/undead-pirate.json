Many battles have raged in the seas and many have died, only to rise once again to raid along the coasts of Myzan.  Fear flows before them as they sail the seas and death fills their sails."

        "en": "A salty and rotten smell often precedes the undead pirate ships.  The ships are specters that appear out of a peculiar fog that settles around them as they move.  Tattered sails flapping in no wind and a “skull and crossbones” atop the mast are images that every mariner fears.  Undead Pirates are the rotting corpses of dead pirates.  Strangely, ranks are still held on an undead ship and the captain is the most elaborately dressed crew member."

The stars were a shinin' and the moon was big 'n full.  We whar sailin' t' Safe Harbor when a unearthly fog rolled in.  We was a'feared cuz th' wind died in our sails an' we was dead in the water.  Suddn'ly we heard an' eerie creakin' that came from the fog.  We all watched in horror as a ghost ship appeered.  Cann'ns 'xploded before we could do anythin'!  The evil terrers boarded our ship an many of 'r bravest jump'd ship.  Others fought abut try's we might, they took our ship and threw us overboard!  It was them ghost pirates I tell ye!  'N I were the only'n to survive…”    A tale heard at the inn of the Silver Sails."
