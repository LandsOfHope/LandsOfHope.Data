        "en": "Although long standing rumors tell of spotting octopus bigger than ships, the real giant octopus is not quite that large. Most often they will weigh around one hundred pounds  and will be almost eighteen feet from one arm tip to another.    The giant octopus, like it`s smaller brethern, is an eight armed cephalopod.  It uses these arms to pull itself from rock to rock along the ocean bottom and to grip it`s prey.    The giant octopus dwells in caves along the ocean bottom where the female will lay thousands of eggs in a few days."

    "hist": {
        "en": "Legends have endured for ages about giant octopus that were able to sink large sea sailing ships.  Tales have been told of red, blazing eyes that suddenly appeared just before massive arms reached out of the waters to grasp and tug a ship to the bottom of the sea, never to be seen again.    Though the size of the giant octopus was largely exaggerated, it was proven to be a real creature when a daring young man explored a sunken ship and discovered one living in the belly of it."
