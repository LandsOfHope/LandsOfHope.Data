        "en": "The deserts of Myzan are often thought of as being vast, barren wastes of golden nothingness.  However, underneath the blistering heat and the steaming sand there lives a creature that has adapted well to the harsh climate.  The giant scorpion, with its great pincers and deadly stinger, has become one of the most identifiable sights of the eastern wastes and several other desert locations.  Normally a scavenger, this scorpion is known to be a vicious hunter when necessary."

        "en": "These arachnids differ in size.  They are most commonly no bigger than a human adult's hand; however, there are unconfirmed reports of scorpions much larger.  Their bodies are made of two sections.  The head houses its many beady eyes, mouthparts, and two pincer arms.  The abdomen carries the other six legs and extends into the long tail tipped by the stinger.  Giant scorpions can come in various colors, though most are shades of yellow or blue.  Males tend to be darker in color than females.  All scorpions have a florescent property, allowing them to glow in the dark."

    "hist": {
        "en": "The deserts of Myzan offer very little in the way of food to sustain any life.  The giant scorpion has made a place in the circle of life as a sand sweeper.  An inventive scavenger, the giant scorpion spends most of its day burrowing under the sand in search of cool spots and buried carcasses.  It will extend its person cave system for miles under the dunes and wastes in its quest for comfort and sustenance.  If it should come across a fallen body, it will inject the carcass with an acid to dissolve the insides so it can feed on the liquid.  On certain occasions, when food is scarce, the scorpion will begin to hunt the living.  As it makes it way through its own tunnels, it will be mindful of shafts and caverns of foreign origin, in which it will investigate and often times perch itself to lie in wait for an unsuspecting victim - a beetle, sandworm, or even another scorpion.  When it ventures to the surface, the giant scorpion must be careful for hungry buzzards and lizards, as well as human hunters, as its stinger is highly prized for its poison and appeal as fine jewelry."
