        "en": "The wyvern is an extremely destructive beast.  A predatory animal, it seems to hate all other races and is willing to dine on anything that breathes and moves. They nest in the higher mountain ranges but will fly over a hundred miles to leave a   swathe of ruins in its wake."

        "en": "A wyvern has the appearance of a dragon with its armoured skin and long snaking neck bearing a long jawed head with many teeth and horned tufts on top. Glittering eyes filled with malice can spy a victim from many miles above the land.  A wyvern  has two extremely strong bird-like legs that propel it into the air and large leathery wings that can carry it for vast distances.  A long tail that ends in a forked barb is one of its most deadly weapons."

    "hist": {
        "en": "Throughout history the wyvern has been the greatest fear of the human settlements. Night or day, the creature flies trying to subdue its endless hunger.  Hunger for both flesh and fear.  Entire villages have been known to vanish in an instant.  The citizens of Myzan have tried for years to erradicate this raging beast. Although they have managed to decrease their population, the wyvern still manages to elude extinction and continues to plague the eastern ranges."
