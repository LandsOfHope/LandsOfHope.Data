        "en": "Lurchers are a relative of the woode and muncher species. They are sentient, and aggressively defend their territories against threats, especially those that wish to cut down their trees or tear up their land for farming. Unlike woodes who try to make peace with humans, lurchers are not so nice. While they can speak the common tongue, they prefer the arboreal language adopted by woodes, munchers, and other sentient plant species."

        "en": "Unless they are moving in their environments, spotting a lurcher is difficult. Their barky skin and root, vine, and branch like appendages allow them to blend into the forests and jungles they inhabit very well. It is said if you see a lurcher, you have already been claimed by the forest."

    "hist": {
        "en": "The old tales of haunted and cursed forests, while thought to be brought on by woodes, are actually tales of lurchers. A Royal Hollow University expedition discovered this a century or so ago. Unfortunately the only way the truth got back were expedition notes explaining how the lurchers peeled the flesh from members of the expedition to use as a form of paper."
