        "en": "Elder Dragons are the oldest of the race of dragons that exist in the land of Myzan. They are more vicious in general, old and wizened from years and centuries of surviving adventurers, weather, and existence overall. They know more than they will ever share.     Their fighting styles are different than anything anyone has ever encountered. They will sneak up behind their food, or anything that threatens them, and roast the creature to a crisp. They weigh more and thus are somewhat slower. They are also many times as strong as their younger brethren.     The elder dragons fly in very small areas. They exist only in the furthest regions of Myzan. Royal Hollow and Seven Sisters are two of the only places that are known to house these rarest breed of dragons. They rarely stray, except for food. They are also known to hibernate for extended periods, for decades even. This is why there is so little known about them. "

        "en": "Elder Dragons' scales are duller than the younger dragons. The colors are less varied in color as well. They are longer, with a wider wingspan, too. They are large enough that they frequently, or, as frequent as can be said for elder dragons, pass for normal mountainous ground. Several adventurers have perished form a misstep and landing on some part of an elder dragon. The wings are frequently 20-30 feet across, bare minimum. The head of an elder dragon is taller than the tallest of humans. Their tales are more than 20 feet long and used as weapons as well. Elder Dragons are taller than buildings. The only difference is that buildings won't kill you."

        "en": "As with their younger, smaller brethren, Elder Dragons are possibly the oldest of the races of Myzan. The difference is that the elder dragons can remember when their race first came to Myzan. They once existed in Knotwood Valley and some parts of Sandydale Basin, but they migrated to Seven Sisters and Royal Hollow decades, even centuries before humans came to Myzan. They have fought in almost every war, in almost any side. They have fought against each other, and have even helped other areas of societies build to fruition. They have, and always will, keep their way of life."
