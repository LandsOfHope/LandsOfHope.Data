        "en": "A race of ghostly figures, the Ghast are the metaphysical perversions of wandering spirits.  More powerful then mere ghosts, these apparitions are the result of a spirit accepting the afterlife while refusing to leave the earthly plane of existence in an effort to seek out immortality - often the goal of self-necromancy.  These dark creatures are often believed to be lost in the minds of men, who only believe their existence in the confines of myth and legend.  With the defeat of the first Reaper horde ages ago, the Ghast were believed lost with all other cursed necromantic abominations."

        "en": "The eyes of men generally do not see the true form of a Ghast when such paths cross.  Men tend to confuse Ghosts and Ghasts, for they do look similar.  Often, a man will simply dismiss an encounter with a Ghast as a product of his imagination and too much ale.  However, while ghosts tend to be pale and transparent representations of a former form, a Ghast has no definite form or shape, often appearing as a nebula or inferno of spiritual energy, faintly radiant or translucent, with its limbs and face composed of this same blazing self-energy.  Each creature has its own distinct flame pattern and color - dark shades usually mark males while lighter shades denote females.  On rare occasions, peasants in outlying villages have reported sightings of walking corpses or skeletons engulfed in similar flames of energy.  The superstitious believe these to be newly turned Ghast."

        "en": "Men have long believed that the wretched dark hordes of the Reapers were exterminated.  In truth, the dark arts of necromancy and other similar black magics have survived, and with them, the undead race of the Ghast has managed to live on as well.  Until recently, only residents of the outermost villages of Myzan recognize the existence of the dark remnant, and their stories of Myzan's ancient past had developed into the fantastic and mysterious legends told throughout the land, even within the halls of the king's own castle.  Stories of armies, of legions of ghastly figures descending on cities and parishes alike, slaughters of men, women, and children with no remorse, stealing their life force, leaving the streets stained with bloodâ€¦ stories of unspeakable devastation.    Today, however, Ghast and other Undead sightings have increased in more populated regions of the kingdom.  These sightings often include horrific deaths and grisly messages written in blood.  It would seem as though the Necromancers of old have returned with a fury hotter then ever before, and the Ghast seem to be preparing the way for yet more destruction.   "
