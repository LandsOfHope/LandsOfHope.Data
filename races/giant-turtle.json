        "en": "These migrating wonders have existed almost since the beginning of time. Living for thousands of years there have been supposed sightings of ancient turtles that claim they were bigger then a full grown man. With agility, strength and combat not being their strong points, nature has given them a form of defense; full body armor. When in peril, can turtles tuck themselves into their shell and are usually completely out of harms way. Few blacksmiths have skill to make a metal as hard as a turtle's shell for it can withstand consistent blows from some of Saloa's finest warriors."

        "en": "These reptiles have green leathery skin around their entire body. A protective shell is wrapped around the turtle with enough holes for its head, four legs, and tail. Its mouth takes the form of a jagged beak, but has no teeth. Its “flippers” have webbed toes, which help it swim, and claws to help it dig."
