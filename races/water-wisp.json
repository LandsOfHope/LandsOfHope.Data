It isn`t until you get close to  them that you notice the membrane that holds their bodies together.  Small creatures,  they travel in groups and seem playful in nature until they feel threatened."

        "en": "Little is really known about the history of the Water Wisp.  No one has ever found a  way to communicate with the tiny creatures.  In fact, no one ever knew they existed  until a wandering explorer named Bumble Flutterfanger fell into the river right into  a pack of the wisps.  Flutterfanger stumbled into Lesser Riverden later that day  covered with welts raving of dangerous, invisible creatures hiding in the waters."
