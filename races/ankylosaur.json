        "en": "Full-grown adults are usually between twenty to thirty feet long. Bony plates cover their hides going from their back to along their sides where spikes grow from these plates. Their tails have a large bone mass at the end making their tails an effective club to ward off the many predators and interlopers to their territory alike."
