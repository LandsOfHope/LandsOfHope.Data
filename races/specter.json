        "en": "Part of the Horde's primary core of combatants, Specters serve alongside other skeletal warriors as the brunt of the Undead's armed forces.  What they lack in strength, Specters easily make up for in endurance and sheer numbers.  They are easily revived from old graves and are often recast as other variations of skeletal creatures by wielders of necromancy.  In battle, it is almost necessary to entirely destroy - obliterate - a Specter to ensure that it won't be resurrected or reformed."

        "en": "Often the product of a wasted Necryte, a Specter is the skeletal remains of a former living being.  The eyeballs may remain in the sockets as deeply glowing disks, but most other organs would have either fallen out or decayed away.  Specters may on occasion don armor; however, the only “clothing” uniformly worn by these creatures are the rotten scraps of flesh that once hid their bleaching bones."

        "en": "The first wielders of necromancy were the first to raise the ancient dead.  Because lifeless bone in weak and frail, old graves were indeed perfect sources for minions.  The resilience and single-mindedness of skeletal warriors made such armies equal parts frightening and deadly, and the added quality of skeletals being more recyclable than simply expendable zombies made such armies more desirable for the First.  Unfortunately, the Necromancers were yet again twisted by their greedy search for dark powers and immortality.  Some of the Necromancers guilty of raising the dead found themselves becoming like the walking skeletons they prized so much.  These were the first Specters."
