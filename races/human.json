Be it their temperment, their choice of profession, choice of allegience or even the crafts and tradeskills they decide to work on, a human is a vibrant being that stands firmly as an individual."

        "en": "Even in appearance the human race is as varied as the rainbow. Tall, short, skinny or massive in build, the human race is colorful. Although humans have the same features, these can come in a large variety of different shades and colors.  Having a hand with an opposing thumb allows a human to build and hold tools which enables him to craft items. Humans dwell just about anywhere on Myzan.  Their homes range from tiny huts hidden far from the eyes of others to villages full of shops and even to vast palaces locked tight and full of hoarded treasures."

Since recorded history began the humans have had a long and bloody past. Love, hate, betrayal, greed,   faithfulness, endurance, passion, honor....so much has contributed to the route humans have taken as a whole.  Where they will go from here is the great unknown...."
