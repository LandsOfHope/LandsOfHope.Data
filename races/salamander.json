        "en": "Salamanders are carnivorous. Most of the smaller ones dine on insects and small animals such as rats and bats.  A salamander responds to movement when it attacks.  A few lucky hunters who survived an attack from the larger cave salamanders told of how once they fell and laid quietly the salamander seemed to lose interest  and moved away.  No stories have surfaced about what happens when a salamander kills because once that happens there are obviously no survivors to report."

        "en": "Salamanders are squat, fat bodied amphibians with short legs and a tail that is usually longer than their body.  In some ways their bodies resemble the alligators but they have no scales or claws. They come in a variety of colors and sizes with the largest seen topping out at five feet in length from head to tail. Salamanders have a soft, moist skin and appear to be relatively harmless, a deception that has caused many a hunter dismay."

        "en": "History has it that once there were two separate species of salamanders. Some of them lived in the waters of Myzan and some on the land.  No one  has seen an aquatic salamander in living memory.  The land bound salamanders once lived deep in the forests and were shy creatures who scurried away from predators.  No one knows what happened but most  salamanders are now found in dank places like caves and dungeons. Now the  salamanders have become the predators and men who enter those places need to be wary and careful.  It is said that some species of salamanders are treasure collectors like dragons but that they only keep magical items like rings in their troves. This belief has lead to the untimely death of many a young man who crawls into the darkness hoping to prove himself by bringing out a special token that might enhance his own powers."
