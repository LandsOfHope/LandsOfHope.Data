Such an action may lower the vessels armor, or hinder its attack potential. The actual&nbsp;effect is entirely random to prevent people from abusing the &quot;strongest&quot; effects. Only one sabotage effect can be in use on a vessel at any one time and they last a number of minutes.</p><p>The Sabotage skill does not go up, and will remain at the value it was when you started.</p>"
