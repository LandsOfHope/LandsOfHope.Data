{"name":{"en":"Floristry"},"desc":{"en":"<p>The <strong>Floristry </strong>skill is a crafting skill that anyone can learn by speaking to the floristry skill trainer. </p><p><strong><font color=\"#05b8cc\">Skill Trainer Location<br /></font></strong>Kaelia Kaka at&nbsp;31,&nbsp;59&nbsp;in Knotwood Valley</p><p>This skill allows you to make flowers, bouquets and other special items that can be used to brighten up your day, given aways as gifts or in some limited cases placed into special rooms.</p><p>One of the primary ingredients in Floristry is &quot;flower seeds&quot; these can be gained by visiting an NPC at 33, 58 Knotwood Valley. You will need to turn over 10 piles of fertile soil to get a packet of 100 flower seeds. This is done as a trophy quest, and soil can be found randomly on grass, desert, earthen and mountain tiles (much like you find herbs). I recommend trying earthen tiles ... these are the brownish tiles to the far East of Springlade as they have a higher spawn rate, you can also find them in Juratania. Also players with Track Items skill can use the Track Items screen to find existing soil spawns that other players have not yet picked up.</p><p>As with all of the crafting skills you will need to learn plans for the&nbsp;floristry skill, seek out a plan trainer for this skill or buy dropped plans from other players. <br /><br />The main trainer is located at 33, 58 Knotwood Valley&nbsp;inside the Florist shop.</p><p><em><font color=\"#ff6666\">You can visit the realm guide pages at Help &gt; Manual &gt; Realm Name to locate both the skill trainer and plan trainers.</font></em></p>"},"group":"crafting"}
